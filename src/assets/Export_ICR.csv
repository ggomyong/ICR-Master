However,\nbefore doing this I check to see if it already exists.\n\nAs the package cannot function without this and some sites may not have\nthe latest Radiology package up (v 4.0, I think) by the time it is sent\nout nationally (probably 1/92), I have been advised by Troy to request an\nagreement to export this and rename it.

Drug Accountability does not write to any IFCAP files.\nLooking toward an interface with the IFCAP Generic Inventory Package, Drug\nAccountability (PSA) begins the process with a Connection Menu.  The\nPSAINIT creates in the DRUG file (#50) a multiple (#50.0441) pointing to\nthe IFCAP ITEM MASTER file (#441), enabling a direct link between the DRUG\nfile (#50) and the ITEM MASTER file (#441).\n\nThe first connecting tool provided in the Connection Menu is a sub-\nmenu using the National Drug Code (NDC) to attempt matching entries.  In\nthe ITEM MASTER file (#441), the NDC field (#4) is located in the VENDOR\nmultiple (#6).  This field has an input transform that prevents a user\nfrom using the same NDC for more than one ITEM MASTER file entry.  In\nstudying an ITEM MASTER file from a local site, it was discovered that\nthere were several entries in their ITEM MASTER file that did possess the\nsame NDC.  Since this situation might lead a connector to link a drug to a\npotentially less active item, the first option in the NDC Menu is the NDC\nDuplicates Report (ITEM file).  This report loops through the NDC ("F")\nx-ref in #441.  If more than one item contains the same NDC and is not\ninactive (field #16, '$G(^PRC(441,D0,3))), the duplicates are listed.  The\nreport displays the NDC that has more than one item attached to it, the\nitem numbers attached, their SHORT DESCRIPTION (#.05), and the VENDOR (#6)\n=> VENDOR file (#440,#1) that contains the duplicated NDC.\n\nThe second item on the NDC Menu is the Report Potential NDC Matches\noption.  This report loops through the active, unlinked (to #441) entries\nin the DRUG file (#50) that have an NDC.  If a corresponding NDC is found\nin the "F" x-ref in the ITEM MASTER file (#441), the NDC and drug name are\nlisted from the DRUG file (#50) and the ITEM NUMBER (#.01) and DESCRIPTION\n(#.1) listed from the ITEM MASTER file (#441).  Using the ITEM NUMBER\n("AB") x-ref in the DRUG file (#50), a check is made to see if the matched\nITEM MASTER file entry is already linked to another DRUG file entry.  If\nso the user is informed of the existing connection.\n\nUsing this same loop and display criteria, the Controlled Connection\nby NDC Match allows the user the opportunity to actually link matched\nentries.  If the user approves the displayed match, a ^DIE stuff of the\nitem number into the item multiple (#50.0441) in the DRUG file occurs.\nLikewise, the Automated DRUG/ITEM file link by NDC option uses the same\nloop and display criteria and the ^DIE stuff for all matches in the loop.\n\nIn the event that the user requires more information about a selected drug\nfrom either the DRUG file or the ITEM MASTER file before linking, the\nInquire/Compare DRUG file/ITEM file option is available.  This option uses\na FM inquire with a no-link pointer jump from the DRUG file to the ITEM\nMASTER file via the NDC "F" x-ref in #441.  The user selects the drug from\nthe DRUG file and along with corresponding info from the DRUG file the\nDESCRIPTION (#.1), NSN (#5), NDC (VENDOR (#6),#4) by which the jump\noccurred, and from that same VENDOR multiple the UNIT COST (#1), UNIT OF\nPURCHASE (#1.5), DATE OF UNIT PRICE (#2.5), PACKAGING MULTIPLE (#1.6),\ncalculated unit cost = UNIT COST (#1)/DISPENSE UNITS PER ORDER UNIT from\nthe DRUG file, VENDOR (#.01), CREATED BY (#15), and with a jump to #200\ntheir OFFICE PHONE NUMBER.  Using this same jump, the DRUG file/ITEM file\nComparison Report displays the same data with the user selecting a range\nof drugs from the DRUG file.\n\nThe FSN Menu functions similar to the NDC Menu.  The Report Potential\nFSN Matches option loops through the active, unlinked (to #441) entries in\nthe DRUG file that have an FSN.  If a corresponding NSN is found in the\n"BA" x-ref in the ITEM MASTER file, the FSN and drug name are listed from\nthe DRUG file and the ITEM NUMBER (#.01) and DESCRIPTION (#.1) listed from\nthe ITEM MASTER file.  Using the ITEM NUMBER ("AB") x-ref in the DRUG\nfile, a check is made to see if the matched ITEM MASTER file entry is\nalready linked to another DRUG file entry.  If so the user is informed of\nthe existing connection.\n\nUsing this same loop and display criteria the Controlled Connection\nby FSN Match option allows the user to actually link matched entries.  If\nthe user approves the displayed match, a ^DIE stuff of the item number\ninto the item multiple (#50.0441) in the DRUG file occurs.  Likewise, the\nAutomated DRUG/ITEM File Link by FSN option uses the same loop and display\ncriteria and the ^DIE stuff for all matches in the loop.\n\nThe Single Drug Match option uses both the NDC and FSN/NSN tools\ndescribed previously to offer a connection for a single selection from the\nDRUG file.  If a link to an ITEM MASTER file entry already exists, it is\ndisplayed to the user and they may edit the connection in the DRUG file.\nUsing the ITEM NUMBER multiple pointer (#50.0441) in the DRUG file, the\nuser can also do look-ups to the ITEM MASTER file via available x-refs\n(NSN (BA), SHORT DESCRIPTION (C), VENDOR STOCK # (D), or NDC (F)) in order\nto select additional connections.\n\nThe Report of Unlinked DRUG/ITEM File Entries lists active drugs from\nthe DRUG file which do not yet have any entries in the ITEM NUMBER\nmultiple (#50.0441).  The Connect Unlinked DRUG/ITEM file Entries option\nloops through these unlinked entries and offers all the tools described in\nthe Single Drug Match option to perform the links.\n\nThe Active, Unlinked Drugs in the ITEM File option allows the user to\nselect a purchase date from which to consider an ITEM MASTER file drug\nactive.  It then loops through the ITEM MASTER file and when an entry's\nFSC (#2) = 6505 (Federal Supply Classification for drugs), is not an\nINACTIVATED ITEM? (#16), is not linked to a\ndrug('$O(^PSDRUG,"AB",ITEM,"")), has an entry in the FCP (#1) multiple,\nand has within at least one FCP entry, an entry in the PURCHASE ORDER (#1)\nmultiple, the P.O. DATE(s) (#442,#.1) are checked against the user\nselected purchase date.  For entries that pass this criteria, the ITEM\nNUMBER (#.01), SHORT DESCRIPTION (#.05), NSN (#5), LAST VENDOR ORDERED\n(#9), NDC (#6,#4) (for the LAST VENDOR ORDERED), and the DESCRIPTION (#.1)\nare displayed.\n\nThe Display Connected Drug option allows the user to print both a\nvendor catalog for a selected item as well as a procurement history.  The\nuser selects an entry from the DRUG file.  If it is connected to more than\none entry in the ITEM MASTER file the user is asked to select one of the\nconnected entries from the ITEM NUMBER multiple (#50.0441).  From the ITEM\nMASTER file, the ITEM NUMBER (#.01), SHORT DESCRIPTION (#.05),and NSN are\ndisplayed. If the selected ITEM MASTER file entry has only one VENDOR (#6)\nor has a MANDATORY SOURCE (#10), then that vendor is displayed along with\nthe VENDOR STOCK # (#3), NDC (#4), PACKAGING MULTIPLE (#1.6), UNIT OF\nPURCHASE (#1.5), UNIT COST (#1), MINIMUM ORDER (#8), DATE OF UNIT PRICE\n(#2.5), and REQUIRED ORDER MULTIPLE (#9).  If there is more than one\nvendor for the item, the LAST VENDOR ORDERED (#9) is displayed as well as\neach available vendor sorted by DATE OF UNIT PRICE (#2.5), beginning with\nthe most recent date.  For each vendor the PACKAGING MULTIPLE (#1.6), UNIT\nOF PURCHASE (#1.5), UNIT COST (#1), DATE OF UNIT PRICE(#2.5), and whether\nor not the vendor has a current contract is listed.  The contract\nverification is made by looping through the CONTRACT NUMBER multiple (#6)\nin the VENDOR file (#440) and checking the EXPIRATION DATE (#1).  If there\nis an entry in the FCP (#1) multiple for the selected item and any of the\nFCP entries have an entry in their PURCHASE ORDER (#1) multiple, the user\nis offered a procurement history.  They can enter a date from which they\nwish to view the history.  They must also select an FCP.  For each\npurchase order that passes the criteria, the PURCHASE ORDER NUMBER (#.01),\nVENDOR (#5), P.O. DATE (#.1), QUANTITY (#40,#2) (LINE ITEM NUMBER located\nusing the "AE" x-ref in the ITEM (#40) multiple), UNIT OF PURCHASE (#3),\nTOTAL COST(#15), and QUANTITY PREVIOUSLY RECEIVED (#11) are displayed.\nAverage ordered/month, total ordered, and total cost are also listed.\nIf the MANDATORY SOURCE (#10) for the selected item is flagged in the\nVENDOR file (#440) with an "S" in the SUPPLY WHSE. INDICATOR (#.05), then\nthe user is informed that the Supply Warehouse is the mandatory source.\nUsing the "AD" x-ref in the INVENTORY TRANSACTION file (#445.2) a check is\nmade for any distribution by the warehouse of this item.  If procurement\nhistory exists, the user is informed and allowed to enter a date from\nwhich to view the history.  By looping through the "AD" x-ref in #445.2\nand checking the TRANSACTION ID (#1)?1"R".N and the DATE POSTED (#2.5) is\nnot less than the user entered date, a history is displayed.  From the\nINVENTORY TRANSACTION file (#445.2), the DATE POSTED (#2.5),\nTRANSACTION/P.O. NUMBER (#410), -QUANTITY (#6), PACKAGING UNIT (#5),\nSELLING UNIT PRICE (#8), and OTHER INVENTORY POINT AFFECTED (#14) are\ndisplayed.\n\nThe Unposted Procurement History and Posted Drug Procurement History\noptions are an effort to restore some of the drug accountability lost with\nthe disappearance of the LOG 036 report.  For the Unposted Procurement\nHistory, the user is asked to select a month to review.  A loop through\nthe PROCUREMENT & ACCOUNTING TRANSACTION file (#442), using the P.O. DATE\n("AB") x-ref collects PO's for the user selected month.  If the COST\nCENTER (#2) = 822400 (Pharmacy) and the SUPPLY STATUS (#.5)>14 & <45\n(basically ordered), the PO's are sorted into ^TMP by Station/FCP.  For\neach Station/FCP the PO's are listed, displaying PURCHASE ORDER NUMBER\n(#.01), P.O. DATE (#.1), FCP(#1), VENDOR (#5), and TOTAL AMOUNT (#91).\nWhile looping through these PO's another ^TMP is created, sorted by the\nDESCRIPTION (#1) of each ITEM (#40) on each PO.  The user is asked if they\nwould like to print item totals.  If so, an alphabetical listing occurs\ndisplaying each ITEM's (#40) DESCRIPTION (#1) and REPETITIVE (PR CARD) NO.\n(#1.5) and each PURCHASE ORDER NUMBER (#.01), P.O. DATE (#.1), FCP (#1),\nQUANTITY (#40,#2), ACTUAL UNIT COST (#40,#5), and TOTAL COST (#40,#15).\nFinally, the user is if they would like a list of high dollar items.  They\nare invited to enter a cut-off dollar amount and each item exceeding that\namount is listed beginning with the highest total cost.  The total cost\nwas determined by totaling the TOTAL COST (#40,#15) amounts for each item\nlisted in the previous display and building a ^TMP to sort from high to\nlow.  Each ITEM's (#40) DESCRIPTION (#1), total TOTAL COST (#15), and\nStation/FCP is shown.\n\nThe Posted Drug Procurement History option uses the TYPE OF INVENTORY\nPOINT ("AC") x-ref in the GENERIC INVENTORY file (#445) to locate a "W" or\nthe warehouse inventory.  A loop through the INVENTORY ITEM (#1) multiple,\nusing the ITEM NO. (#.01) to check in the ITEM MASTER (#441) file for a\nFSC (#2) = 6505 (Federal Supply Classification for drugs) isolates the\nwarehouse drugs in ^TMP.  Looping through ^TMP a check is made using the\nINVENTORY POINT ("AD") x-ref in the INVENTORY TRANSACTION (#445.2) file to\nisolate items that have had distribution (TRANSACTION ID (#1)?"R".N) and\nfall within the user selected month (DATE POSTED (#2.5)).  These\ntransactions are sorted by the OTHER INVENTORY POINT AFFECTED (#14) and\nthe OTHER INVENTORY POINT AFFECTED (#14) , -QUANTITY (#6), QUANTITY\n(#410,#10,#2) obtained by using the TRANSACTION /P.O. NUMBER\n(#445.2,#410), PACKAGING UNIT (#5), SELLING UNIT PRICE (#8), total cost\n(-QUANTITY (#6) * SELLING UNIT PRICE (#8)), DATE POSTED (#2.5), and\nTRANSACTION/P.O. NUMBER (#410).  Similar to the Unposted Procurement\nHistory, a high dollar sort is also offered.\n\nAs stated in the opening paragraph, the Connection Menu lays the\ngroundwork for an interface with the IFCAP Generic Inventory Package.\nPhase two of this process is contained in a Pharmacy Location Menu.  With\nthis menu the Pharmacy user will create and edit the parameters of a Drug\nAccountability location such as Inpatient, Outpatient, or a Combined\n(IP/OP) operation.  The purpose of the interface is to allow the receiving\nthat occurs in the Inventory Package to pass the converted dispensing unit\nquantity of a connected drug (ITEM/DRUG file) from a Generic Inventory\npoint (#445) to a Drug Accountability location (#58.8).  To establish a\ndirect link between these two files, a PRIMARY INVENTORY POINT field\nexists in the DRUG ACCOUNTABILITY STATS file (#58.8).  This field points\nto the GENERIC INVENTORY file (#445) uses the TYPE OF INVENTORY POINT\n(#.7) = "P" and COST CENTER (#.9) = 822400 (Pharmacy) fields as screens.\nThe input transform also contains a call to ^PSAUTL where the "E" x-ref in\n#58.8 is checked to prevent the linking of one primary inventory point to\nmore than one DA location.  The Set up/edit a Pharmacy Location option\nallows the user to edit this link.  If a DA location (#58.8)is linked to\nan Inventory point (#445), the INVENTORY ITEMS (#1) are checked both\nagainst the "AB" x-ref in the DRUG (#50) file and the "C" x-ref in the DA\n(#58.8) file to see if all Inventory items are tracked in DA.  If not the\nuser is given the ability (^DIE) to add Inventory items to the DA\nlocation.  The Display Location option shows the PRIMARY INVENTORY POINT\n(#11) currently linked to the selected DA location.\n\nThe Inventory Interface sub-menu contains three report options and a\npopulate option.  The Report of Inventory items' link to DRUG file\ndisplays from a selected GENERIC INVENTORY point (#445), selection\nscreened by COST CENTER (#.9) = 822400 and TYPE OF INVENTORY POINT (#.7) =\n"P", the ITEM NO. (#445,#1,#.01), either the DESCRIPTION (#.7) or from the\nITEM MASTER file (#441), the SHORT DESCRIPTION (#.05)and if connected the\nDRUG (#50) name.  The Loadable Inventory Items Report operates exactly the\nsame, however, only lists connected items.  The Populate Pharmacy Location\nwith Inventory items option uses the same criteria and if a connected drug\nwithin an inventory point does not yet exist in the DRUG (#10) multiple in\nthe selected DA location (#58.8), a ^DIE stuff occurs with a list of drugs\nloaded displayed at a user selected device.  The Display Drugs Not Loaded\nin Primary option loops through the DRUG (#10) multiple in a selected DA\nlocation (#58.8) and using the "AB" x-ref in the DRUG (#50) file, checks\nthe "AE" x-ref in the GENERIC INVENTORY (#445) file for the existance of\neach drug in the linked Primary Inventory Point.  Those drugs not found in\nthe Inventory point are displayed along with their ITEM MASTER (#441) file\nNUMBER (#.01) and SHORT DESCRIPTION (#.05).\n\n\nCONDENSED DATA DICTIONARY---DRUG FILE (#50)    VERSION:  6\n\nSTORED IN: ^PSDRUG(                                       01/26/93\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCROSS REFERENCED BY:\nITEM NUMBER(AB)\n\nFILE STRUCTURE\n\nFIELD     FIELD NUMBER    NAME\n\n.001      NUMBER (NJ5,0), [ ] .01       GENERIC NAME (RF), [0;1] 6\nFSN (F), [0;6] 12        ORDER UNIT (P51.5'), [660;2] 13        PRICE PER\nORDER UNIT (NJ7,2), [660;3] 14.5      DISPENSE UNIT (F), [660;8] 15\nDISPENSE UNITS PER ORDER UNIT (NJ4,0), [660;5] 16        PRICE PER\nDISPENSE UNIT (NJ6,2), [660;6] 17        SOURCE OF SUPPLY (F), [660;7] 31\nNDC (FX), [2;4] 100       INACTIVE DATE (D), [I;1] 441       IFCAP\nITEM NUMBER (Multiple-50.0441), [441;0]\n.01  ITEM NUMBER (M*P441'X), [0;1]\n\nCONDENSED DATA DICTIONARY---ITEM MASTER FILE (#441)UCI: LTL,VAA\n\nSTORED IN: ^PRC(441,                                      01/26/93\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCROSS REFERENCED BY:\nSHORT DESCRIPTION(AC)  INACTIVATED ITEM?(AD)\nNUMBER(B)  NSN(BA)  NSN(BB)  SHORT DESCRIPTION(C)\nVENDOR STOCK #(D)  NDC(F)  NSN(G)\n\n\nFILE STRUCTURE\n\nFIELD     FIELD NUMBER    NAME\n\n.01       NUMBER (RNJ6,0X), [0;1] .05       SHORT DESCRIPTION (RFX), [0;2]\n.1        DESCRIPTION (Multiple-441.02), [1;0]\n.01  DESCRIPTION (W), [0;1] 1         FCP (Multiple-441.03),\n[4;0]\n.01  FCP (RFX), [0;1]\n1    PURCHASE ORDER (Multiple-441.04), [1;0]\n.01  PURCHASE ORDER (P442'X), [0;1]\n3    PREFERRED VENDOR (*P440'), [0;3] 2         FSC (RP441.2'),\n[0;3] 5         NSN (FX), [0;5] 6         VENDOR (Multiple-441.01), [2;0]\n.01  VENDOR (MP440X), [0;1]\n1    UNIT COST (RNJ10,3), [0;2]\n1.5  UNIT OF PURCHASE (RP420.5'), [0;7]\n1.6  PACKAGING MULTIPLE (RNJ6,0), [0;8]\n2    CONTRACT (NJ6,0XO), [0;3]\n2.2  CONTRACT EXP.

The way that\nMailMan calls DIWE allows a slightly different set of functionalities.\nThe transfer command is defaulted to use the 3.9 (Message) file if no file\nis specified.  DWPK forces automatic wrapping of text at DWLW number of\ncharacters.  Because of this the variable DC must have the appropriate\nvalue and MailMan kills it to may sure it is undefined.  DWLW and DWPK\nhave recently been released along with EN^DIWE as a callable entry point,\nbut the use of DIC and DIA together still provide to MailMan special\nfunctionality in the FileMan line editor, namely the ability to transfer\nlines of text in from other messages that the  user is the sender or a\nrecipient of.\n	EN

234	DBIA234			0	Mailman is given permission to make the following calls to Kernel:\n\n1.   CHK^XM is an entry point set aside only for calls external from\nMailMan.  It is used by KERNEL routines to notify users of new messages\nfor a user during logon or as invoked from MenuMan. XMDUZ is used if\nsupplied, otherwise DUZ is a pointer to the user's Mailbox.  The symbol\ntable of the caller is changed as the code currently stands.  Y is output\nas a count of new messages.  % and D are also used and not killed by\nMailMan.  The Kernel security routine will continue to use this entry\npoint, which also is necessary to make sure that ^TMP("XMY",$J) is cleaned\nout on login and ensures that when job numbers are reused after reboot,\nthere is not data in ^TMP("XMY",$J) to include recipients from old mail\nsessions in currently generated bulletins that come from outside of\nMailMan.  An example is the 'Dropping into Programmer Mode bulletin'.\n\n2.   ^XM may be called in order to offer MailMan as a service directly to\nusers on logon.\n\n3.   The XMUSER and XMMGR menus may be used in high level menu structures.\n\n4.   Kernel modules to which this document refers are (even if they are at\nsome point separated from the Kernel and become independent modules of\ntheir own) are System security (XU* and XT*).\n\n5.   Kernel security and user related modules currently can call NEW^XM to\nset up an new user's or reactivated user's mail box.  The entry point uses\nthe variables I, Y and K destructively.  If it is called for a user who is\nbeing reactivated, that user will not receive responses to messages he is\na recipient of and were created before his reinstatement, unless he is\nexplicitly forwarded them, or he 'owns' the original message in one of his\nmail boxes.\n\n6.   XMPC is called by the Kernel routine comparer.  All the proper set-up\nhas been done and MailMan will coordinate any changes in this area with\nthe programmer responsible for Kernel Utilities.\n\n7.   Kernel directly references the 5th piece of the Mail Basket multiple\nof the Mail Box file (3.7) to get the number of messages in a mail basket.\n\n8.   Kernel directly references the 6th piece of the zero node of the Mail\nBox file (3.7) to get the number of new messages in a mail box\n\n9.   There are some data fields in the Mail Box file (3.7) that are not\nused in MailMan.  They are used by sign-on security and should be\nmaintained by sign-on security routines also.\n\nfield #        Description         node;piece\n20   Last Sign-on Date/Time        .1;1\n21   Last Terminal Type Used       .2;1\n22   Already Signed On To Devices  100 (multiple)\n\n10.

259	DBIA259	R	PRCPUX1	0	Drug Accountability, V2.0, has established agreement with IFCAP to make\nthe following calls:\n\nIFCAP inventory provides a Primary Inventory Point with the SPECIAL\nINVENTORY POINT TYPE = "D" for Drug Accountability, the ability to update\na Drug Accountability Location with all receiving activity.  IFCAP has\nadded two new fields to the INVENTORY ITEM multiple in the GENERIC\nINVENTORY file (#445), the DISPENSING UNIT and DISPENSING UNIT CONV\nFACTOR.\n\nEach item that a Primary Inventory Point receives, the IFCAP routines\nPRCPPOL1, PRCPWPL4, PRCPWPP3, and PRCPUUIW call EN^PSAGIP to update drug\naccountability.  It is here that Drug Accountability is called (EN^PSAGIP)\npassing the Primary Inventory Point, the item, the quantity*dispensing\nunit conv factor, the PO#, the CP transaction #, the inventory transaction\n#, and the total price and in some cases the NDC.  Drug Accountability\nadds each item received to a temporary global. After the receipt is\nprocessed, the IFCAP routines PRCPAWI1, PRCPPOL1, PRCPWPL5, and PRCPWPP3\ncall EX^PSAGIP to complete the drug accountability update.  At this time a\ntask is started, looping through the temporary global and either updating\nthe Drug Accountability Location or building and sending a mailman message\nlisting those items that could not be updated and why. In version 2.0 of\nDrug Accountability the cost center screen on the Primary Inventory\npointer in the DRUG ACCOUNTABILITY STATS file (#58.8) has been replaced\nwith the "D" for special inventory type.  Also the IFCAP security\nvariable, PRCPPRIV is used to enable this pointer.\n\n^DD(58.8445,.01,0) = PRIMARY INVENTORY POINT(S)^M*P445'X ^PRCP(445,^0;1^S\nPRCPPRIV=1,DIC("S")="I $P(^(0),U,20)=""D""" D ^DIC K DIC S DIC=DIE,X=+Y K\nPRCPPRIV K:Y<0 X S:$D(X) DINUM=X\n\nWherever available, calls to IFCAP extrinsics have replaced Drug\nAccountability version 1.0 look-ups to ^PRC globals.  The IFCAP inventory\nroutine PRCPUX1 is called extensively throughout the Drug Accountability\npackage at the following line tags:\n\nUNITVAL(V1,V2,V3) ; unit per issue for values passed as follows\n; v1=packaging multiple, v2=units da,\n; v3=delimiter;\n\nUNITCODE(V1)      ; get 2 character unit code from file 420.5\n; for entry v1;\n\nNSN(V1)           ; return nsn for item v1;\n\nDESCR(V1,V2)      ; description from inventory point or item\n; master file for item v2 and inventory point\n; v1;\n\nINVNAME(V1)       ; inventory point name for inventory point v1;\n\nVENNAME(V1)       ; return vendor name for da;global (445 or\n; 440).\n\n	UNITVAL	UNITCODE	NSN	DESCR	INVNAME	VENNAME

262	DBIA262			0	DataBase Integration Agreement between IFCAP V4.0 package and FileMan\nV19.0 for the use of and the KILLing of a local FileMan variable in an\nInput Template.\n\nThe IFCAP Input Template uses the FileMan local variable D1 in the input\ntransform for field #40 in File #423, the CALM/LOG CODE SHEET file. The\nlocal variable D1 is used as a counter for the multiple field 423.05,\nsubfield .01.  IFCAP uses the counter within the Input Template to ensure\nthat no more than 10 entries are made into the code sheet for this\nmultiple.  Prior to prompting the user for entries into this field, the\nFileMan variable D1 is KILLed.\n\nThe reason or reasons for KILLing the FileMan local variable D1 and\nsubsequently using D1 as a counter have been obscured in the history of\nIFCAP development.\n\nThe variable D1 is the internal record number within the multiple; it is\nstored as piece 3 of the file or subfile header.  It is not necessarily\naccurate as the count of entries within the multiple.  For example, the\nuser may make one or more deletions within the template, reducing the\nnumber of entries.  The user could then add more entries to the multiple.\nThis scenario could possibly increase the internal record number (D1) to a\nnumber greater than 9,  when there may actually be fewer than 9 entries.\nBased on the input transform, the user would not be able to make the\nadditional entries, although in reality, more entries should be allowed.\n\nIn addition, piece 4 of the file or subfile header contains the number of\nrecords in the file and/or subfile.  Once again, this number cannot be\nguaranteed as the accurate number of records in the file or subfile.\n\nThe use of D1 is an existing convention that has been in place for several\nversions of IFCAP.  We request the Integration Agreement with FileMan to\ncontinue this use for IFCAP V4.0.\n\nThe Input Templates are used in the creation of CALM code sheets. Since\nFMS will be replacing CALM, the use of the FileMan local variable will be\nneeded until all sites have converted from CALM to FMS.  The next planned\nrelease of IFCAP V5.0 will replace this function.\n\nINTEGRATION POINT:\n\n1.

270	DBIA270-A	G	PS(52.6,	52.6	Drug Accountability will use the IV STATS (#50.8) file to update IV\ndispensing activity in a Drug Accountability Location.  To correctly\nidentify the DRUG (#50) file entry a look up is first made to the IV\nADDITIVES (#52.6) and/or the IV SOLUTION (#52.7) files.  Looping through\n^PS(50.8,D0), all IV Rooms are checked.  Looping through\n^PS(50.8,D0,2,D1), dates are checked.  Looping through\n^PS(50.8,D0,2,D1,2,D2), drugs are checked with support from the "AC"\nx-ref.  Looping through ^PS(50.8,D0,2,D1,2,D2,3,D3), ward is checked.  It\nis here that, if a match occurs,\n$P($G(^PS(50.8,D0,2,D1,2,D2,3,D3,0)),U,2)-$P($G(^(0)),U,5) is used to\nupdate the balance in Drug Accountability.\n\nGLOBAL MAP DATA DICTIONARY #52.6 -- IV ADDITIVES FILE STORED IN ^PS(52.6,\n(1 ENTRY) SITE: BIRMINGHAM ISC\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCROSS REFERENCED BY: GENERIC DRUG(AC) ^PS(52.6,D0,0)= (#1) GENERIC DRUG\n[2P]\n

352	DBIA352	G	DD(	0	PCE (PX) is granted permission to execute the DD nodes for completing\ncross-references in the 9000001 file from within cross-reference logic on\nthe Social Security (.09) field in the Patient file.  There is a Regular\n"B" cross-reference on the .01 field (NAME) of the PATIENT/IHS file\n(9000001).  There is also a Regular "D" cross- reference on the .02 field\nof the 9000001.41 Health Record Number multiple.  Since the fields in the\n9000001 file are being populated from during the execution of the Patient\nFile (2) PX09 cross- reference, the DD logic for setting these\ncross-references is being handled by executing the 9000001 and 9000001.41\nDD nodes with the set and kill logic.\n\nRoutine PXXDPT executes the set logic of the 'B' cross reference of file\n9000001, (Patient/IHS File), field .01 (Name).\n\nIt also executes the set and kill logic of the 'D' whole file cross\nreference of subfile 9000001.41, (Health Record Fac), field .02 (Health\nRecord No.)\n\nIn V21 of FileMan, the entry points in ^DIK that reindex cross references\nare reentrant.  Thus, direct execution of set/kill logic will not be\nnecessary.\n\nAlso PCE's Debugging Utility does a Global Read in the form of\n'$D(^DD(2,.09,1,800)) to check that the cross reference to update the\nPATIENT/IHS file (#9000001) exists.\n

367	DBIA367	R	VALM	0	Request: Use of the routine calls REFRESH^VALM and RESET^VALM4:VALMCC\n\nInput: none\nOutput: none Purpose: These calls are used to refresh the screen and\nreset the\nscrolling area while program control remains within an\naction (as opposed to performing the same action when exiting\nan action, which is accomplished by setting VALMBCK="R").\n\nRequest permission to set the variable VALM("PROTOCOL").  The purpose of\nsetting this variable is to be able to define the specific protocol to be\nexecuted for a list template, as opposed to defining three identical list\ntemplates, all with different protocol menus.\n\nResetting VALM("PROTOCOL") resets the protocol menu.  This allows having\nthe same list manager definitions for a screen that may have different\ninput capabilities, for example one with input and one just view only\nactions.\n\nRESET^VALM4 can ONLY be called if VALMCC is high(1)\n\nThe context for these calls are as follows: The calls will be made within\na List Manager application, specifically within various options of the\nEncounter Form Utilities. The reason for making the calls is that we want\nto be able to display an encounter form in the top part of the screen\nwhile having a dialogue with the user in the bottom part of the screen.\nThe problem is that it is necessary to call FileMan at certain points\nwithin the dialogue. FileMan assumes it has the entire screen at its\ndisposal, so when it communicates with the user the display#is likely to\nscroll out of the scrolling area on the bottom of the screen, so the user\nis  unable to read what FileMan displays. To avoid that, what we do is: 1)\nEverywhere FileMan is called in the situation described above we call\nFULL^VALM1. That sets the scrolling area to the entire screen.  2) When\nthe problem point is passed and we want to continue the dialogue with the\nencounter form displayed at the top we call REFRESH^VALM to redraw the\nscreen. Then we call RESET^VALM4 to reset the scrolling area so that the\ndialogue can occur on the bottom of the screen with the form displayed at\nthe top.\n\nVALMCC is an input variable to RESET^VALM4. VALMCC must test true or\nRESET^VALM4 should not be called. There are dozens of variables that are\nset by the List Manager, but those are part of the internal workings of\nthe List Manager and are not the concern of this application.  There are\nsome List Manager variables that the application is responsible for\nsetting, but those are well documented by the List Manager, i.e., they are\nnot specific to calling these entry points.\n\nThe context is that the List Manager has been called. Then, from within\nthe List Manager, the user has selected an action, which invokes a\nprotocol. The protocol invokes a routine, which is where those calls are\nmade.\n	REFRESH

896	DBIA896	G	AUPNPAT(	9000001	**  A DBIA agreement is being requested by the Patient/IHS Subset package\n(PXPT) with the Indian Health Service.  This agreement would document\nthe changes in the use of the Patient/IHS file in the VA. **\n\nThis description includes a comparison of the VA's Patient/IHS File\n(9000001) as distributed in the PXPT package and the IHS's Patient/IHS\nFile (9000001).\n\nNOTE:  Per discussions previously with IHS developers, George Huggins has\nagreed to have the file named "Patient" file (9000001) in IHS changed to\nthe name "Patient/IHS" file.\n\nVA Patient/IHS File:\n====================\nThe VA version of 9000001 has a subset of fields defined in the IHS\nversion.  The main consideration for determining what should be\ndistributed in the VA was: "What is the minimal set of data required to\nhave the Patient/IHS file\ndefined and be useable by IHS tools, such as QMAN".  Sending out the\nminimum set limits the confusion of sending out Patient/IHS fields and\npointed to files that could cause confusion in the VA.\n\nSummary of differences in File and fields:\nFile SPECIAL LOOKUP ROUTINE is sent out as DPTLK\nFile POST SELECTION ACTION is sent out as D ^AUPNPAT\nThe only fields destributed in VA nationally are NAME,\nLOCATION OF HOME,\nand HEALTH RECORD NO. multiple.\nThe Health Record No. multiple has had a few changes.\nThe .01 field is based on the Default institution in the\nKernel Site Parameter file because the DUZ(2) upon\nadding a patient may not reflect the institution the patient\nshould be related to.  (e.g., Regional Office adding Patients)\n\nThe .02 field has been changed to be a freetext field long\nenough for a SSN or pseudo-SSN or DOD PID with dependent\ncounters.\n\nThe following is the Standard List of Attributes for the VA version:\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nSTANDARD DATA DICTIONARY #9000001 -- PATIENT/IHS FILE    05/26/94  PAGE 1\nSTORED IN ^AUPNPAT(  (406 ENTRIES)   SITE: SLC   UCI: DVA,DEV\n\nDATA          NAME                  GLOBAL        DATA ELEMENT       TITLE\nLOCATION      TYPE\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis file is IHS's primary patient data file.

These things may have no affect on you whatsoever, but you\nneed to know so you can make your own judgement:\na)  Currently the exam statuses (file 72) each can be used for any\nexam regardless of imaging type.  In Version 4.5, exam statuses\nwill be specific to imaging type.  We are adding the basic statuses\n(WAITING FOR EXAM, CALLED FOR EXAM, EXAMINED, CANCELLED, COMPLETE)\nto this file for each of the 8 imaging types.  (i.e. there will be an\nEXAMINED status for General Radiology, an EXAMINED status for\nNuclear Med, an EXAMINED status for Ultrasound , etc..  so that\neach imaging department can set up their exam status parameters\ndifferently.)\nb)  Because of item a above, the 'B' cross-reference on file 72\nbecomes much less meaningful - there will now be 8 instances of\neach of the basis exam statuses.  This may affect the proposed DBIA.\nSince the sites can add their own site-specific statuses, it's\npossible to have many instances of any status.  So, the 'B' x-ref no\nlonger represents a unique status name.\n^RA(72,D0,0)\n.01      CURRENT EXAM STATUS  0;1      Read w/Fileman\n^RA(72,'B',X,DA)\n.01      CURRENT EXAM STATUS           Direct Global Read & w\nB cross-reference is used to\ndetermine STATUS.\n^RA(72,'AA',\nDirect Global Read Access permitted.\n

As an option, many of the parameters\nassociated with the servers are embedded in the definition of the option.\nTherefore, in order to understand servers completely, you should refer to\nthe server documentation in Kernel 7.0 manuals.  Options are listed in the\nMenu Management documentation.\n\nServers may or may not receive data.  The received data usually comes in\nthe form of the text of the message being delivered to it, but the data\nmay also be pointed to by the message, and exist in the system either\nbecause it was there in the beginning, or because it arrived\nindependently.\n\nServers may be addressed from a remote  site.  A server on ALTOONA.VA.GOV\nmay receive a message addressed to it from WASHINGTON.VA.GOV.  In fact,\nthis is very common.  There are security features as parameters of the\noption that has been designated as a server because of the fact.  Please\nbe aware of these security parameters.  Messages addressed to servers will\nnot be scheduled if security is not passed.  Filegrams work through use of\na server.  Data is loaded into a mail message, addressed and when\ndelivered, processed by the filegram server into the receiving database.\n\nServers are always invoked through tasks that are set up when the message\nis delivered into the system locally or over the network.  One of the\noptions is to "Run Immediately".  Then the task is scheduled to run "NOW".\n\nHowever, tasks may not need to be scheduled at all because the system\nmanager has stated so in the entry for the server in the Option file or\nbecause of a problem.  See the Menu Management documentation in the\nMailMan Technical Manual and Systems Management Guide for more information\nconcerning this.\nServer Statuses\n\nServer recipients are recorded in the recipient chain of a message and\nappear similarly to other users.  MailMan enters statuses on its own as\nstages in the server process are reached.  First, the message is marked as\n"Awaiting Server".  This indicates that the message has been received and\nthe option is a valid one.  At this point, a task has been created to\nactually invoke MenuMan to schedule or perform the service (option)\nrequired.\n\nThe last status which MailMan sets is "Served", which means that MenuMan\nhas been called successfully and MenuMan has either performed the task in\nthe case of a server that runs immediately, or that some other action has\nbeen done.\n\nAt this point, a task could be scheduled to invoke the server or simply a\nmessage could be sent to indicate that the task exists and needs to be\nscheduled, or some other action that was required was performed.  MenuMan\nhas its own statuses which will be used.\n\n\n$$SRVTIME^XMS1\n\nThis extrinsic function sets status of recipients in a message.\n\nUsage: S X=$$SRVTIME^XMS1(A,B,C)\n\nWhere: A = XMZ (message number)\nB = A string representing the recipient name\nC = Status is free-text (String less than nine (9)\ncharacters in length)\n\nIf successful, X = 0\n...or If unsuccessful, X will be a number followed by a\nhuman readable error\n\nAddressing a Server\n\nTo address a server, precede the recipient name with "S." (e.g.,\nS.XMECHO).  This example sends a message to the Mail Man Echo Tester\nserver.  "S." must be followed by an option name from the Option file in\nthe Target Domain.  If not, a "Recipient not Found" error will occur.\n\nA "Recipient Ambiguous" error will occur, if there is more than one option\nwhose name partially matches the name addressed.\n\nThe District Registry server for admitting a new patient could be\naddressed as follows:\n\nS.DGDISTADMIT@SANFRANCISCO.VA.GOV\n\nThe message is destined for the DGDISTADMIT option at San Francisco.\nReplies to this message would be from this same name.\n\n\nWriting a Server Program\n\nThe server communicates with mail messages in specific ways.  Code is used\nto interface the server to the message system.  The code below returns the\noriginal message to the sender:\n\nECHO    ;\nK XMY\nS XMSUB=$E("Server echo of'"_XMBSUB_"`",1,65)\nS XMY(XMFROM)="",XMTXT="^XMB(3.9,"_XMZ_",2,"\nD ^XMD\nQ\n\nIn this example, the variable XMFROM contains the sender address and is\nsupplied to the server when invoked.  Other variables also exist upon\ninvocation of the server.\n\nThe XMF.1 example server program is supplied with MailMan.  XMF1 uses some\nof the other variables supplied to the server.\n\nExecute variable XMREC to read a line of the message.  XMER and XMRG are\nreturned.\nXMER  This variable returns the execution status of XMREC.  XMER<0, if\nthere is no more message text to read.  The value of XMER will be zero\n(0), if XMRG is being returned as non-null.  XMRG, in that case, will have\nas its value the text of the next line of the message.\n\nXMRG   The value of XMRG will be the next line of message text.  XMRG will\nalways be defined, though it will be null when XMER<0.\n\nXMPOS  This variable contains the current position of the text returned in\nthe variable XMGR.  It is initialized if it is undefined, but should be\nkilled by the server when it is finished "Reading" the message.\n\nHere's another example of code, this time from XMF1:\n\nS XMA=0\nA  ;\nX XMREC        ;       Receive a line\nI $D(XMER) G Q;XMER<0  ;       Check for end of message\nS XMA=XMA+1    ;       Increment local line count\nS XMTEXT(XMA)=XMRG     ;       Set local array\nG A    ;       Go back for another line\n\nDouble Serving Messages\n\nOn occasion, the transmission/receive process is interrupted by a system\nback-up.  It appears to result in the same message being served twice.\nThe Audit Log for the Options file shows two messages with the same\nmessage number and subject, but with different Date/Times and Job Numbers.\n\n\nTo avoid this, application servers should be written such that they check\nfor and avoid processing of the same message being delivered to any\nparticular server.  MailMan transparently checks this and does not deliver\ntwice to mail boxes.  However, devices and servers do not have mail boxes\nto check against.  Servers can have some understanding of special mail\nbaskets in the Postmaster's mail box and can be written to check for\nduplicate deliveries (See reference XMAIC entry points in the Callable\nRoutines section of the Technical Manual and System Manager's Guide).\n	STATUS	SRVTIME

1298	PXK VISIT DATA EVENT			0	The Scheduling Developers are requesting permission to hook the the\nprotocol named SDAM PCE EVENT to the ITEM multiple of the protocol named\nPXK VISIT DATA EVENT.\n\nThis protocol event point was developed to publish data collected by PCE\nduring an encounter via manual data entry or scanned encounter forms.  The\ndata represents elements that are stored in the Visit file (9000010) and\nother PCE V-Files.\n\nThe data is stored in a ^TMP global array with subscripts denoting the\ncategory of published data.  An AFTER and BEFORE subscript are included to\ndistinguish changes made to data elements during the encounter session.\nThe data published in the ^TMP global represents data from one encounter.\nThe structure of the ^TMP global that is published is:\n\n^TMP("PXKCO",$J,VISIT,"V FILE STRING",V FILE RECORD,DD SUBSCRIPT,\n"AFTER/BEFORE")=DATA\n\nIn cases where there is a CPT modifier, the following structure will be\nused, this will capture multiple entries for the sub-file.\n^TMP("PXKCO",$J,VISIT,"V FILE STRING",V FILE RECORD,DD SUBSCRIPT,\n"AFTER/BEFORE",DATA)=""\n\nIn cases where there is an Immunization VIS, Other Diagnosis, or Remarks,\nthe following structure will be used, this will capture multiple entries\nfor the sub-file.\n^TMP("PXKCO",$J,VISIT,"V FILE STRING",V FILE RECORD,DD SUBSCRIPT,\n"AFTER/BEFORE",V SUBFILE RECORD)=DATA\n\nTemporary global file root:  ^TMP\n\nSubscript Piece:  1 Description:  String notation representing Package\nContents:  "PXKCO"\n\nSubscript Piece:  2 Description:  Job Number Contents:  $J\n\nSubscript Piece:  3 Description:  Internal Entry Number of the Visit (IEN)\nContents:  Number\n\nSubscript Piece:  4 Description:  String representing the Visit or V file\ndata category.

1449	CHANGE PACKAGE FILE ENTRY			0	The Allergy Tracking System package is changing its name to Adverse\nReaction Tracking when the next version (4.0) is released. The Expert\nPanel feels this is a more accurate name for what the package does. When\nVersion 4.0 is installed, the environmental check routine will do a\nlook-up (using a DBS call) on the 'C' cross-reference of the PACKAGE file\n(#9.4) to find the appropriate entry and change the .01 field value to\n'ADVERSE REACTION TRACKING'. The package's namespace is GMRA.\n\nAlso, the PACKAGE file entry contains the old name and version number as\ndata in the SHORT DESCRIPTION (#2) and DESCRIPTION (#3) fields.

1569	TEXT INTEGRATION UTILITIES	R	VALM	0	TIU is using List Manager.  For one of our LM displays, we need to display\nat the beginning of the screen a 60 character name, then 4 or 5 short\nfields, then a different 60 character name.  Sites don't want either 60\ncharacter name truncated.  Since the screen is only 80 characters wide, we\nneed to set one scroll lock long enough to display a meaningful part of\nthe name and still show our short fields, and then to set a second, very\nshort scroll lock so we can display the whole second 60 character name\nwith enough scroll locked to identify the entry.\n\nI have found that if I set VALM("FIXED") and VALMLFT, I can essentially\nset two different scroll locks, enabling me to display both 60 character\nnames meaningfully.\n\nThis also enables me to code a PRINT LIST Action which prints columns\nbeyond page width on a separate page rather than wrapping them.  Since we\nare using many columns beyond 80 characters, this is important to our\nusers.\n\nFor the sake of clarity, this was NOT a simple matter of setting those two\nvariables:  I also had to rewrite for TIU the Scroll Right/Left actions\nand the Print List Action rather than use the actions LM exports.\n\nTIU requests a private Integration Agreement with List Manager to read and\nset the variables VALMLFT and VALM("FIXED").\n\nWe understand that if/when LM adds functionality affecting these\nvariables, we would need to rewrite portions of our code.\n	EN

PCE  was tasked with developing the API.\n$$DATA2PCE^PXAPI\nwas developed to enable the adding, editing and deletion of encounter,\nprovider, diagnosis and procedure data.  Data will be stored in the\nVisit\nand V files and will be posted on the PXK VISIT DATA EVENT for use by\nsubscribing packages such as Scheduling.\n\nThis document includes:\n1. Definitions and Conventions used to describe the API.\n2. Description of $$DATA2PCE^PXAPI, its parameter definitions, and\nthe\nreturned values.\n3. A table which describes the subscripts used for passing data to\nPCE.\n4. An example array for passing data to PCE.\n\nDEFINITIONS AND CONVENTIONS:\n\nListed below are definitions and conventions used to describe this API.\n\n1. Valid data values:  [ 1 | 0 | null ]\n`1'  Denotes TRUE or YES\n`0'  Denotes FALSE or NO\nnull  Denotes VALUE NOT KNOWN\n2. Counter "i" is used as a subscript.  It denotes a sequence number,\ni.e., 1, 2,\n3. To denote deletion of a data ITEM, pass the "@" symbol as the data\nvalue in the node for the item being deleted.  You may not delete\nrequired data items.\n4. To denote deletion of an ENTRY, pass "1" as the data value in the\n"DELETE" node of the identified entry.\n\n\n$$DATA2PCE^PXAPI(INPUT_ROOT,PKG,SOURCE,.VISIT,USER,ERRDISP,.ERRARRAY,PPEDIT,\n.ERRPROB,.ACCOUNT)\n\nThis is a function which will return a value identifying the status of\nthe\ncall.  Data that is processed by PCE will be posted on the PXK VISIT\nDATA\nEVENT protocol.\n\nParameter Description:\n\n1. INPUT_ROOT:  (required)  Where INPUT_ROOT is a unique variable\nname, either local array or global array, which identifies the\ndefined data elements for the encounter.  An example of an\nINPUT_ROOT is ^TMP("LRPXAPI",$J) or ^TMP("RAPXAPI",$J).  The gross\nstructure of the array includes four additional subscripts\n(ENCOUNTER, PROVIDER, DX/PL, PROCEDURE and STOP)  for defining the\ndata passed.  A detailed description of this array and its\nstructure are included below in a table format.\n\n2. PKG:  (required)  Where PKG is a pointer to the Package  File\n(9.4).\n\n3. SOURCE:  (required)  Where SOURCE is a string of text (3-30\ncharacter) identifying the source of the data.  The text is the\nSOURCE NAME field (.01) of the PCE Data Source file (839.7).  If\nthe SOURCE currently does not exist in the file, it will be added.\nExamples of  SOURCE are:  "LAB  DATA" or "RADIOLOGY DATA" or "PXCE\nDATA ENTRY" or "AICS ENCOUNTER FORM."\n\n4.

The PCE Device Interface uses a locally name-spaced array\n(called\nLOCAL in this document ) with the following gross structure to\nreceive data from an external device. Developers should use an\narray in their namespace to represent the LOCAL array. It is\npossible that data from multiple providers was captured for the\nencounter. The ENCOUNTER node records information about the\n"main" provider. It is mandatory that this person be identified\nin the ENCOUNTER node. Data will NOT be moved to VISTA if such a\nprovider is not identified on the ENCOUNTER node. The remaining\nnodes in the LOCAL( array [VITALS, DIAGNOSIS, PROCEDURE,\nPROBLEM... ] are specific to the particular PROVIDER associated\nwith the data on that node. If the provider is unknown, (for\nexample, the identity of the nurse who took the vitals was not\ncaptured on a scanned encounter form) the provider subscript\n<PROVIDER IEN> may be set to zero except provider is required\nfor\nPROBLEM. This is a concession to reality, and should not be\nencouraged. If a provider CAN be identified, they SHOULD be\nidentified.\n\nLocally name-spaced array:\nLOCAL("DIAGNOSIS/PROBLEM",<PROVIDER IEN>)\nLOCAL("PROBLEM",<PROVIDER IEN>)\nLOCAL("SOURCE")\nLOCAL("ENCOUNTER")\nLOCAL("DIAGNOSIS",<PROVIDER IEN>)\nLOCAL("PROCEDURE",<PROVIDER IEN>)\nLOCAL("PROVIDER",<PROVIDER IEN>)\nLOCAL("IMMUNIZATION",<PROVIDER IEN>)\nLOCAL("SKIN TEST",<PROVIDER IEN>)\nLOCAL("EXAM",<PROVIDER IEN>)\nLOCAL("PATIENT ED",<PROVIDER IEN>)\nLOCAL("HEALTH FACTORS",<PROVIDER IEN>)\nLOCAL("VITALS",<PROVIDER IEN>)\nVitals are not processed by PCE but are passed to the\nVitals/Measurement package.\nLOCAL("LOCAL",\nThis data doesn PCE and will not be\nprocessed by PCE, but it may be used to pass local\ndata\nto a local process (see protocol for local data\nprocessing).\n\n3.

The data in the rest of the nodes with the\nassociated providers build on the clinically relevant data set\nand are not used for workload\n\n7. While ENCOUNTER, PROCEDURE, and DIAGNOSIS/PROBLEM or DIAGNOSIS\nvalues are required to capture workload and generate a bill,\nthey\nmay not be present in every data set passed through this event\npoint. For example, data on Vitals may be collected by a Nurse\nand passed through the event point for storage independent of\nother data associated with the encounter.

1900	DBIA1900-A	R	VSIT	0	Visit Tracking is a utility that can be used by a variety of VISTA\nmodules\n(usually via PCE), with potential benefits for clinical,\nadministrative,\nand fiscal applications. Visit Tracking will allow VISTA packages to\nlink\nan event to a patient visit entry, thereby linking that event to any\nnumber of events occurring throughout the hospital during the patient's\noutpatient and/or inpatient episode.\n\nVisit Tracking is not a stand-alone application. Other packages will\nnormally call PCE, which will handle the calls to Visit Tracking.\n\n\nThe key to the creation of visits will be to ensure the clinical\nmeaningfulness of visits.  The creation of visits is facilitated by the\nVisit Tracking module. In order to ensure a consistent implementation\nof\nvisit creation across packages, each package needs to have an agreement\nwith the Visit Administrator to create visits.\n\n\nThis section describes the guidelines which should be used for VA\ndevelopers populating visits in the Visit file. These guidelines are\nbased\non a combination of the experience of Albuquerque's joint venture\nsharing,\nIHS' PCC pilot test at Tucson VAMC, MCCR data capture pilots, HSR&D\nworkload reporting studies at Hines VAMC, and DMMS/DSS event data\ncapture.\n\nThe purpose of the VISIT file in the VA:\n\nThe VISIT file has multiple purposes. The primary role is to record\nwhen\nand where clinical encounters related to a patient have occurred.\nVisits\nwill be recorded for both Outpatient and Inpatient encounters.\n\nOutpatient encounters include scheduled appointments and walk-in\nunscheduled visits.\n\nInpatient encounters include the admission of a patient to a VAMC\nand\nany clinically significant change related to treatment of that\npatient. For example, a treating specialty change is clinically\nsignificant, whereas a bed switch is not. The clinically\nsignificant\nvisits created throughout the inpatient stay are related to the\ninpatient admission visit.\n\nIf the patient is seen in a clinic while an Inpatient, a separate\nvisit will be created representing the appointment visit?this\nvisit\nis related to the Admission visit.\n\nA clinician's telephone communications with a patient may be\nrepresented by a separate visit.\n\nThe clinical visits can be viewed from two approaches: 1) a team\nof\nproviders can be associated with a primary clinical visit (this is\nthe traditional view taken by IHS); or 2) a primary clinic visit\ncan\nrepresent the primary provider's care, and a separate visit can be\ncreated to reflect the secondary provider's care.\n\nAdditionally, the VISIT file can provide a breakdown of other\nancillary services provided during the clinically significant\nvisit.\nLaboratory or Radiology services are other examples of services\nprovided that could have a separate visit reflecting the service\ninvolvement related to a clinic appointment on the same day.\n\nCreate and/or Match Visit Using Input Criteria\n\n^VSIT\n\nINPUT:\nVSIT                   <visit date [and time] in FM format>\nVSIT("VDT") may be used instead of\nVSIT.\n(time will default to 12 noon if not\nspecified)\n\nDFN                    <patient file pointer>\nVSIT("PAT") may be used instead of\nDFN.\n\n[VSIT(0)]              <a string of characters that defines\nhow\nthe visit processor will function, see\npackage-wide variables>\n\n[VSIT("<xxx>")]        <array with mnemonic subscript>\n(used in match logic if VSIT(0)["M")\n(for SVC, TYP, INS, CLN, ELG, LOC)\nNote: For multiple field values use\n[<field value>[^...]]\ni.e., VSIT("SVC")="H^D"  (will find\nboth)\n\nVSITPKG                <package name space>\nVSIT("PKG") may be used instead of\nVSITPKG.\n\nOUTPUT:\nVSIT(<ien>)            N^S[^1]\nwhere:\nN = <internal entry number of visit>\nor -1 if could not get a visit\nor -2 if calling package is not\nactive in Visit Package\nParameters\nS = <value of .01 field of visit>\n1 = <indicates that a new visit was\nadded\n\nVSIT(<xxx>)            array passed in with all the entries\ndefined and the defaulted values added\n\nVSIT(<ien>,<xxx>)      returns the data that is stored in the\nVisit file in the same format as\nVSIT(<xxx>)\n\nVariable descriptions:\n\nVSIT(<xxx>)         Variable Names for VISIT file fields,\nWhere <xxx> is a general reference to the field\nmnemonic.\nfile: 9000010, global: ^AUPNVSIT(\n\nKey                 Indicates\n\nr                   indicated a required field m\nmatching/screening logic can/does apply s                   system\ngenerated e                   strongly encouraged\n\nKey     Field    Variable         Description\n\n.001    VSIT("IEN")     NUMBER (visit internal entry number) rm\n\n.01     VSIT("VDT")     VISIT/ADMIT DATE&TIME (date) s       .02\nVSIT("CDT")     DATE VISIT CREATED (date) m       .03     VSIT("TYP")\nTYPE (set) rm      .05     VSIT("PAT")     PATIENT NAME (pointer\nPATIENT\nfile\n#9000001) (IHS file DINUMed to\nPATIENT\nfile #2) m       .06     VSIT("INS")\n\nLOC.

2098	DIQUIET TO SUPPRESS WRITES			0	1. DESCRIPTION OF USE OF DIQUIET IN FILEMAN\n\nHISTORY OF DIQUIET: The purpose for creating DIQUIET was mostly that as we\nwere creating the data-base server calls, we sometimes needed to call into\nClassic FileMan, and we absolutely didn't want FileMan to talk.  DIQUIET\nwas a variable that would let us know within those classic calls that we\nwere being called from a DBS call, so we shouldn't talk. Therefore, at the\nstart of almost all the DBS calls, we set DIQUIET=1.  DIQUIET was also\nused as a flag in EN^DDIIOL, which is embedded in Xecutable code in the\nDD, to assure that text is placed in ^TMP instead of being Written when\nDBS calls are involved.\n\n\nSETTING DIQUIET WITHIN FILEMAN CODE: DIQUIET is set to 1 at the start of\nthe following published calls:\n\nFinder                       FIND^DIC\nFinder (Single Record)       $$FIND1^DIC\nLister                       LIST^DIC\nDD Field Retriever           FIELD^DID\nDD Field List Retriever      FIELDLST^DID\nDD File Retriever            FILE^DID\nDD File List Retriever       FILELIST^DID\nAttribute Retriever          $$GET1^DID\nData Checker                 CHK^DIE\nFiler                        FILE^DIE\nHelper                       HELP^DIE\nUpdater                      UPDATE^DIE\nValidator                    VAL^DIE\nWord-Processing Filer        WP^DIE\nSingle Data Retriever        $$GET1^DIQ\nData Retriever               GETS^DIQ\n\nIn addition, there are a few places that Classic FileMan sets DIQUIET for\nthe same reason.\n\nImport Tool (DDMP, DDMPU) because the Import tool is designed to be\nsilent like the DBS calls.\n\nDIED and DIEZ1 (classic DIE call to edit data) sets DIQUIET if the user\nis stuffing data in a SET OF CODES field, because it makes a call to ^DIR\nand does not want the Reader to talk.\n\nDIEZ, DIKZ and DIPZ (template and x-ref compilation) appear to have\nsilent entry points (all labeled EN2) that set DIQUIET.  I believe that\nthese were created by Rick, I don't think they're documented.  Perhaps\nKIDS uses them, I need to discuss this with him.\n\nDIP (the PRINT routine) sets DIQUIET if it is not already set, and if\nall the information that DIP normally prompts the user for has been sent\n(I.E., file and fields to print, sort criteria, device, etc.), or if the\nprint job is queued.  That was to avoid some places where FileMan was\nwriting error messages.\n\n\nHONORING DIQUIET TO SUPPRESS WRITES: Mostly we made changes to classic\nFileMan as we needed to, in places where we were calling it from the new\nDBS calls and wanted it to be silent. The places are:\n\nDDIOL (The loader), where DIQUIET tells the routine to load the text that\nis passed into an array rather than writing it.  That's why we were able\nto tell people that any writes that they have in their DDs should call\n^DDIOL rather than just write.\n\n%DT (date validation routine) to keep the date from echoing back.\n\nDT^DICRW (routine that sets up required FileMan variables).  Was writing\na line-feed.\n\nDIE3 (enter/edit)  Does not write "Searching for a..." when doing a\nlookup on a file pointed-to by a variable pointer, and does not ask OK\nwhen a pointed-to entry is found, even if the DD has been set up that way.\n\nDIP  The changes to the print are described above, and were not done for\nthe DBS calls, as we don't call the print from within any of them.\n\nDIR1  The Reader doesn't write a message when processing sets of codes if\nDIQUIET is set.  This was required by DIE when stuffing a SET OF CODES\nfield, as I described above.\n\n2. REASON RPC BROKER NEEDS TO SET DIQUIET:\n\nSetting of DIQUIET variable, which is used within the VA FileMan package\nto suppress WRITEs from FileMan routines and DDs, to 1.  Variable being\nset by RPC Broker when it is certain that no direct user-interaction is\nappropriate (client/server environment).\n\nThe only FileMan code that the Broker does directly that requires DIQUIET\nto be set is DT^DICRW (a linefeed is suppressed).  However, since the\nBroker performs the code written in RPCs, having DIQUIET set protects the\ncode in the RPCs from inadvertently Writing because of a call to a FileMan\nroutine or the Xecution of a DD node.\n

This is useful if a large conversion needs to\nrun in background while users are back on the system.  For example, the\nfirst KIDS build can install a new version of software, then task off a\nsecond clean-up/conversion build.  This allows users back on the system\nbecause the new version install completes and unlocks options and\nprotocols. Meanwhile the clean-up runs in background under KIDS and makes\nuse of KIDS checkpoints, restart upon failure, and message logging that\ncan later be accessed in the Install File Print.\n	EN

2263	SUPPORTED PARAMETER TOOL ENTRY POINTS	R	XPAR	0	Parameter Tools is a generic method of handling parameter definition,\nassignment, and retrieval.  A parameter may be defined for various\nentities where an entity is the level at which you want to allow the\nparameter defined (e.g. package level, system level, division level,\nlocation level, user level, etc.).  A developer may then determine in\nwhich order the values assigned to given entities are interpreted.  The\nfollowing are some basic definitions used by Parameter Tools:\n\nEntity:\n=======\nAn entity is a level at which you can define a parameter.  The entities\nallowed are stored in the Parameter Entity file (#8989.518).  The list of\nallowable entities at the time this utility was released were:\n\nPrefix          Message         Points to File\n-------         ----------      ------------------------\nPKG             Package         Package (9.4)\nSYS             System          Domain (4.2)\nDIV             Division        Institution (4)\nSRV             Service         Service/Section (49)\nLOC             Location        Hospital Location (44)\nTEA             Team            Team (404.51)\nCLS             Class           Usr Class (8930)\nUSR             User            New Person (200)\nBED             Room-Bed        Room-Bed (405.4)\nOTL             Team (OE/RR)    OE/RR List (101.21)\n\n(Note:  entries will be maintained via ToolKit patches.  Entries\nexisting in the file at the time it is referenced are\nconsidered supported.)\n\nParameter:\n==========\nA parameter is the actual name which values are stored under.  The name\nof the parameter must be namespaced and it must be unique.  Parameters\ncan be defined to store the typical package parameter data (e.g. the\ndefault add order screen in OE/RR), but they can also be used to store\nGUI application screen settings a user has selected (e.g. font or window\nwidth).  When a parameter is defined, the entities which may set that\nparameter are also defined.  The definition of parameters is stored in\nthe PARAMETER DEFINITION file (#8989.51).\n\nValue:\n======\nA value may be assigned to every parameter for the entities allowed in\nthe parameter definition.  Values are stored in the PARAMETERS file\n(#8989.5).\n\nInstance:\n=========\nMost parameters will set instance to 1.  Instances are used when more\nthan one value may be assigned to a given entity/parameter combination.\nAn example of this would be lab collection times at a division.  A single\ndivision may have multiple collection times.  Each collection time would\nbe assigned a unique instance.\n\nParameter Template:\n===================\nA parameter template is similar to an input template.  It contains a list\nof parameters that can be entered through an input session (e.g. option).\nTemplates are stored in the Parameter Template file (#8989.52).  Entries\nin this file must also be namespaced.\n\n\nThis integration agreement defines the callable entry points in routine\nXPAR.\n\n	EN	ADD	CHG	DEL	NDEL	REP	GET	GETLST	GETWP	ENVAL	PUT

2365	Merge File Entries	R	XDRMERG	0	Overview\n\nA file in which entries need to be merged may be entered in the DUPLICATE\nRESOLUTION file (file 15.1).  This requires adding the file as one which\ncan be selected as the variable pointer, and search criteria would usually\nneed to be specified to assist in identifying potential duplicate pairs\n(although an option can be use by which selected pairs can be added\ndirectly to the DUPLICATE RECORD file as verified duplicates).  Verified\nduplicate pairs may be approved for merging, and a merge process generated\nfor those approved pairs.  A DUPLICATE RECORD file entry will also have\nhandle files which are not associated as normal pointers identified in the\nPACKAGE file under the 'AFFECTS RECORD MERGE' subfile with special\nprocessing routines.\n\n***IF A FILE HAS RELATED FILES WHICH ARE NOT NORMAL POINTERS, THEY SHOULD\nBE HANDLED ONLY AS ENTRIES IN THE DUPLICATE RECORD FILE AND THE TOOLKIT\nOPTIONS USED FOR MERGES INVOLVING THE FILE.***\n\nThe merge utility of Kernel Toolkit as revised by patch XT*7.3*23 provides\nan entry point which is available to developers for the merging of one or\nmore pairs of records (a FROM record and a TO record) in a specified file.\nThe merge process me rges the data of the FROM record into that of the TO\nrecord and deletes the FROM record, restoring by a hard set only the zero\nnode with the .01 value on it until the merge process is completed (such\nthat any references to that location via pointers will not error out).\nAny files which contain entries DINUMed with the data pairs are then also\nmerged (and any files which are related to them by DINUM as well).  Any\npointers which can be identified rapidly by cross-references are modifie d\nso that references for the FROM entry become references to the TO entry\ninstead.  Following this, any files which contain other pointers are\nsearched entry by entry to test for pointers to a FROM entry, and when\nfound are modified to reference the TO entry.  This search for pointer\nvalues is the most time consuming part of the entire process and may take\nan extended period depending upon the number of files that must be\nsearched, the number of entries in those files, and how many levels of\nsubfiles pointers may be located at.  Since the search through these files\nwill take the same period of time independent of the number of pairs which\nare being merged, it is suggested that as many pairs as convient be\ncombined in one proc ess.  At the end of the conversion of these pointers,\nthe zero node stubs will be removed from the primary file and all related\nDINUMed files.\n\nThe merge process is a single job which is tracked with frequent updates\non location and status from start to finish.  The job can be stopped at\nany time if necessary using Task Manager utilities (or in the event of a\nsystem crash, etc.) and restarted at the point of interruption at a later\ntime.\n\n\nThe manner in which data is merged.\n\nWhen a primary file or a DINUMed files entries are merged, any top level\n(single value) fields which are present in the FROM entry which are not\npresent in the TO entry will be merged into the TO entries data.  Any of\nthese fields which contain cross-references will be entered using a VA\nFile Manager utility (FILE^DIE) so that the cross-references will be\nfired.  Other fields (those without cross-references) will be directly set\ninto the data global.\n\nIf a subfile entry exists in the FROM record which is not present in the\nTO record (as identified by the .01 value), that entry will be created\nwith a VA File Manager utility (UPDATE^DIE) and the rest of the subfile\nmerged over into the TO record and the cross-references within the subfile\nand any descendent subfiles run.\n\nIf a subfile entry exists in the FROM record and an identical .01 value\nexists in the TO record, the subfile in the FROM record will be searched\nfor any descendent subfiles which are not present in the TO record\nsubfile.  If such a subfile is found it will be merged into the subfile in\nthe TO record and any cross-references in the merged subfile run.\n\nFor fields which are simple pointers to the primary file (or any other\nfile DINUMed to the primary file) the reference to the FROM record will be\nchanged to a reference to the TO record.  If the field contains a\ncross-reference this editing will be performed using a VA File Manager\nUtility call (FILE^DIE), otherwise it will be set directly into the global\nnode.\n	EN	RESTART

2502	DBIA2502	R	PXKMAIN	0	An integration agreement is needed with the PCE package for the Scheduling\ndata conversion project.  The PCE package's standard filer entrypoints\nrequire that all providers added to PCE for a visit have a valid provider\nclass.  The problem is that some of the encounters that the Scheduling\nconversion can convert will consist of old provider data where the\nprovider class for the provider does not exist. As a result, many many\nproviders will not be able to be converted with their visits/encounters\nbecause they do not have a valid provider class.  Denis Eaton was\nconsulted about this and he concluded the only way to store these old\nproviders in PCE would be to pre-set the global array that PCE uses to\nfile the data to what it would look like after all the edit checks were\ndone, and call the filer directly.  Since the affected provider data is\nold and its corresponding visit will be flagged as historical in PCE,\nthere should not be a data integrity issue with storing a provider without\na valid provider class. It also makes the conversion more consistent and\ncomplete.  This exemption is requested specifically for filing the new\nprovider data and would be a one-time exemption to be used only when new\nvisits are created as a result of the conversion.  All other data added to\nPCE via this project would flow through the normal PCE edits.

AO^SDCO22, EC^SDCO22, IR^SDCO22, and\nCLV^SDCO22 always return zero for an SC 50-100% vet -- therefore Event\nCapture never prompts for any of these classifications even though the\nencounter is not related to the patient's service connected disabilities.\n\nLooking into the Scheduling checkout functionality, it is CLASS^PXBAPI21\nwhich allows this scenario to be properly handled (starting in INTV^PXAPI)\n-- it allows the user to answer AO/IR/EC/CLV for SC 50-100% vets after\nspecifying that the encounter isn't service connected.\n\nSpecifically, the call will be constructed as follows:\n\nN PBXDATA\nD NOW^%DTC S DATE=%\nD CLASS^PXBAPI21("",DFN,DATE,1,"")\n\nAn example of user prompts for an SC 50-100% patient with exposure to AO,\nIR, EC, and CLV follows:\n\n--- Classification --- [Required]\n\nWas treatment for SC Condition? NO\nWas treatment related to Agent Orange Exposure? YES\nWas treatment related to Ionizing Radiation Exposure? YES\nWas treatment related to Environmental Contaminant Exposure? YES\nWas treatment related to Camp Lejeune Exposure? YES\n\nData is returned as follows:\n\nPXBDATA(1)=0^1       <-- Agent Orange\nPXBDATA(2)=0^1       <-- Ionizing Radiation\nPXBDATA(3)=0^0       <-- Service Connected\nPXBDATA(4)=0^1       <-- Environmental Contaminants\nPXBDATA(5)=0^1       <-- Camp Lejeune\nwhere the 2nd piece indicates the user's answer to the\nclassification prompt -- 0=NO, 1=YES\n\n\n\n	CLASS

The APIs do not\ncontain any checks to ensure that it was appropriate to call them.  That\nis the responsibility of the calling routine.\n\nFor these APIs, it is expected that:\n\nINIT^XMVVITAE   has been called to set up the user's XMV array, with vital\nuser information, user preferences, and, if the user is a surrogate,\ndetermine level of authorization.  See DBIA 2728 for information on\nINIT^XMVVITAE.\n\nThe calling routine has determined that the user is authorized to see the\nmessage.  If the message is in the user's mailbox, then that's enough.\nOtherwise, $$ACCESS^XMXSEC should be used to determine authorization.  See\nDBIA 2731 for information on $$ACCESS^XMXSEC.\n\nOPTMSG^XMXSEC2  has been called and has given its permission to edit the\nmessage or to toggle information only.  (Note:  $$EDIT^XMXSEC2 will also\nlet you know whether the user may edit the message.) See DBIA 2733 for\ninformation on OPTMSG^XMXSEC2A and $$EDIT^XMXSEC2.\n\nOPTEDIT^XMXSEC2 has been called and has given its permission to edit the\nparticular thing we are editing here.  See DBIA 2733 for information on\nOPTEDIT^XMXSEC2.\n\nINMSG2^XMXUTIL2 has been called to set XMINSTR.  These routines expect\nthat XMINSTR has been correctly set.

If the MPI is not\navailable, a local ICN will be assigned instead.  If the MPI does not\nalready know of this patient, the patient will be added and assigned an\nICN.\n\nThe call to accomplish this task is MPIQ^MPIFAPI(DFN), where DFN is the\nIEN of the patient in the Patient file.  This code is to be inserted after\nall the required data has been collected on a new patient (new to the\nPatient file (#2)).

A parameter may be defined for various\nentities where an entity is the level at which you want to allow the\nparameter defined (e.g. package level, system level, division level,\nlocation level, user level, etc.).  A developer may then determine in\nwhich order the values assigned to given entities are interpreted.\n\nParameter:\n==========\nA parameter is the actual name which values are stored under.  The name of\nthe parameter must be namespaced and it must be unique.  Parameters can be\ndefined to store the typical package parameter data (e.g. the default add\norder screen in OE/RR), but they can also be used to store GUI application\nscreen settings a user has selected (e.g. font or window width).  When a\nparameter is defined, the entities that may set the parameter is also\ndefined.  The definition of parameters is stored in the PARAMETER\nDEFINITION file (#8989.51).  KIDS exports them.\n
2993	DBIA2993	R	DGRUDD01	0	RAI/MDS has requested Integrated Billing add cross references to 5\nInsurance Type (#2.312) fields to monitor changes to the patient's\ninsurance data.  Execution of the cross reference will result in an entry\nin the ADT/HL7 PIVOT file (#391.71) and mark it as requiring transmission\nof an HL7 demographic A08 update message to the COTS interface.\n\nThe local variable DGRUGA08 will be set to 1 if the cross reference is not\nto be executed as part of a re-indexing.\n\nUpdate: IB*2*497 increased the length of the SUBSCRIBER ID field to\nsupport the EDI New Standards and Operating Rules for VHA providers. This\nrequired length increase made it necessary to move the location of this\nfield to a new Data Dictionary node in the INSURANCE TYPE sub-file.  To\nsupport this implementation, all subscribers to this ICR will need to make\nthe necessary changes in their applications.  The ADGRU cross- reference\ncannot be implemented at the new field (2.312, 7.02) until the old field\n(2.312, 1) has been deleted. Therefore rather than IB*2*497, IB*2*518 will\nneed to implement the ADGRU cross-reference at the new field and delete\nADGRU cross-reference at the old field. The old and new field are noted in\nthe field list detail of this ICR.\n\n\nFields cross-referenced in the Patient File Insurance Type multiple:\n\n2.312, .01  Insurance Type  (x-ref #1)\n2.312, .18  Group Plan  (x-ref #1)\n2.312, 1    *Subscriber ID  (x-ref #1)\nNote: IB*2*497 - replaced by SUBSCRIBER ID field (7.02)\n2.312, 7.02  Subscriber ID (x-ref to be determined by IB*2*518)\n2.312, 3    Insurance Expiration Date  (x-ref #1)\n2.312, 8    Effective Date of Policy  (x-ref #1)\n\nThe following cross reference is added to all 5 fields:\n\nCROSS-REFERENCE:  ADGRUxx\nTYPE:  MUMPS\nSET:  D:($T(ADGRU^DGRUDD01)'="") ADGRU^DGRUDD01(DA(1))\nKILL:  D:($T(ADGRU^DGRUDD01)'="") ADGRU^DGRUDD01(DA(1))\n	ADGRU

The HANDLE can be used in another\nRPC to check the status of the RPC.\n\nParameters:\n(location<station #>,rpc name,[rpc version],[1 to 10 params to the RPC))\n\nReturn:\nThe return value is always an array.  The first node of the array is\nequal to a string that serves as a HANDLE.

The call point for\n\nDBIA# 3484 - phase I software - is $$CM^HLUCM.  The call point for this\nDBIA - phase II software - is $$CM2^HLUCM.\n\n$$CM^HLUCM returns the number of discrete message occurring during a\nparameter-defined period of time.  $$CM2^HLUCM returns the number of\n"message units" during the same period of time.  All other totals returned\nby both parameters are identical.\n\nA message is an individual message, such as an application\nacknowledgement.  A message unit is made up of all related messages.\n\nThe difference between a message (phase I, $$CM^HLUCM) and a message unit\n(phase II, $$CM2^HLUCM) can be illustrated using the following sequence of\nevents.\n\n* Baltimore sends a message to Washington.  * Washington sends back a\ncommit acknowledgement to Baltimore.  * Washington sends an application\nacknowledgement to Washington.  * Baltimore sends back to Washington a\ncommit acknowledgement\nfor the just sent application acknowledgement.\n\nIn the above example, $$CM^HLUCM would report a count of 4 messages.\n$$CM2^HLUCM would report a count of 1 message, or "message unit."

3567	Imaging - MAGGSIUI	R	MAGGSIUI	0	Imaging v3.0 patch MAG*3.0*7 introduces an Image Import API that can be\nused to automatically import image files into VistA Imaging.  The image\nfiles can be from a medical device (instrument) or a network or local\ndrive.  Once image files are imported, they are available for display from\nthe VistA Imaging Clinical Display application.\n\nImporting image/report files is a two step process:\n\nStep 1:  The calling program initiates the import proces by sending an\ninput array to the Import API.  The import API uses the input array to\ncreate an entry in the Import Queue file and returns a status array to the\ncalling program.\n\nStep 2:  After the entries in the Import Queue file are processed (by the\nBackground Processor residing on the network), the Import API reports back\nto the calling program in a result array.\n\nNote:  The Import API, as part of the VistA Imaging software, is regulated\nas a medical device.  The Import API cannot be used without a written\nagreement between the VistA Imaging SD&D group and the party wishing to\nuse the Import API.\n\n\nTo secure an agreement for the use of the Import API, the following\ncriteria must be met:\n\n\n1)      Any products built or interfaced using the VistA Imaging Import\nAPI must be tested with VistA Imaging.  Testing will be performed by the\nVistA Imaging team with assistance from field sites and the calling\npackage.  This testing must demonstrate that there are no adverse\ninteractions affecting the safety, efficacy or performance of the VistA\nImaging software or the devices interfaced to VistA Imaging.\n\n2)      Any changes to packages/product(s) using the VistA Imaging Import\nAPI must be reported to the VistA Imaging Project Office for review and\ntesting before release.  Retesting of VistA Imaging with the product(s) is\nrequired with any change.\n\n3)      Documentation that imported reports/objects meet VHA, regulatory,\nand quality requirements must be on file with the Vista Imaging Project\nOffice prior to any clinical use.  Sample imported reports/objects shall\nbe provided initially to the VistA Imaging Project Office by the package\nusing the API.  Sites installing the VistA Imaging API must comply with\nall VistA Imaging requirements and are responsible for filing all required\ndocumentation with the VistA Imaging Project Office, including image\nquality and data forms and sample reports/objects from any interfaced\ndevice.\n\n4)      Additional requirements may apply to non-VA software using the\nImport API.\n	IMPORT

Once the user selects a record, the "out" array will\nbe populated with the set of attributes for that vendor reurned by CoreFLS\n(for details, see "OUTPUT" below).\n\nThe set of fields for which the user will be prompted is controlled by the\nsecond parameter to the vendor query (see below under "Syntax"). If no\nparameters are supplied, the default is to query for name only. Any fields\nfor which the user supplies no value are ignored, otherwise, the search\ncriterion will be the Boolean AND of the supplied parameters (i.e., each\nfield must match).\n\nBy default, if the user enters an unquoted string, it will be intepreted\nas a (case sensitive) initial substring. Thus, CITI matches CITIBANK, but\nCiti will not. (In this case, if the user enters CITI, the string actually\nsent to CoreFLS is "CITI%"). As an alternative, users may enter either\nexact matches or patterns involving the SQL wildcard characters '%' and\n'_' in quotes. E.g.,\n\nVendor Name: "CITI%NK" City: "L_s Ang%es"\n\n\nExample:\n\nVendor Name: "%TEMS%"\n. . . . . . . .\n\nChoose from:\n1    ACCESS SYSTEMS\n1116 SMITH ST\nCHARLESTON, WV  25301\n\n2    BARD ACCESS SYSTEMS\n5425 W AMELIA EARHART DR\nSALT LAKE CITY, UT  84116-3713\n\netc.\n\n\nSelect QUERY RESULTS SEQ NO: 2   BARD ACCESS SYSTEMS\n5425 W AMELIA EARHART DR\nSALT LAKE CITY, UT  84116-3713\n\n\n\n\n\nSyntax:\n\nD VENQ^CSLVQ(.out,flags,display_flags)\n\n\nINPUT This call has three parameters, a reference to an array that will be\npopulated with the attributes of the selected vendor, a scalar variable\ncontaining 0 or more flags indicating which fields should be used as input\nparameters/searchable fields, and a scalar variabld containing 0 or more\nflags controlling what will be displayed to the user as identifying text\n(i.e., as Fileman identifiers).\n\nThe format of the output array is described below under "OUTPUT". The\nsecond parameter may contain any combination of the following flags (order\nis unimportant):\n\n\nN = Name\n\nn = Vendor Number\n\na = Area Code\n\np = Phone Number\n\nC = City\n\nS = State\n\nT = Tax ID/SSN\n\n1 = Address Line 1\n\n2 = Address Line 2\n\n3 = Address Line 3\n\nP = Postal Code\n\nc = Chain number\n\nFor example, to query by name and SSN, use "NT". If this parameter is\nomitted (or if it is equal to the empty string), the default is to search\nby name only. However, if a value is supplied, "N" will not be\nautomatically added to the list. Thus, "T" will cause the user to be\nprompted for Tax ID only.\n\nThe display_flags parameter may contain any combination of the following\nflags (again, order is unimportant):\n\nn = CoreFLS Vendor ID / CoreFLS Site ID\n\nA = address\n\nt = telephone no.\n\nT = Tax ID\n\nC = Chain no.\n\nP = Participation code\n\na = Attributes (Purchasing, Pay-to, etc.)\n\nNote: If the "n" flag is included, the CoreFLS vendor ID and CoreFLS site\nID will appear on the first line of the identifying text displayed for\nthat vendor with the vendor name immediately below.\n\nIf this parameter is missing or null, the default is to display only\naddress information (i.e., the default is "A").\n\nOUTPUT\n\nA single array is passed by reference ("out" in the above syntax example).\nIf the user selects a vendor, the array will be populated with the\nattributes of that vendor as follows:\n\n\nout("NAME") - Vendor name\n\nout("NUMBER") - numeric vendor ID\n\nout("INACTIVE") - vendor will be inactive after this date (FM format)\n\nout("TAXID") - Tax ID\n\nout("AREA_CODE") - area code\n\nout("PHONE") - phone number\n\nout("FAX_AREA_CODE") - FAX area code\n\nout("FAX") - FAX number\n\nout("ADDRESS1") - address line 1\n\nout("ADDRESS2") - address line 2\n\nout("ADDRESS3") - address line 3\n\nout("CITY") - City\n\nout("STATE") - State\n\nout("COUNTY") - County\n\nout("ZIP") - Postal code\n\nout("COUNTRY") - Country\n\nout("SITE_CODE") - Site Code\n\nout("CHAIN_NO") - Chain Number\n\nout("COMMENTS") - Comments\n\nout("PARTICIPATION_CODE") - Participation  Code\n\nout("LAST_UPDATED") - date vendor record last updated on CoreFLS\n\nIn addition, there are a number of optional vendor attributes. If an\nattribute is present, the appropriate top level subscript will be set. For\nexample, for an EDI vendor, we will have\n\nout("EDI_VENDOR")=1\n\nThe complete list of attribute subscripts is\n\nON_HOLD PRIMARY_PAY_TO RFQ PURCHASING PAY_TO PROCUREMENT_CARD\nPRICER_EXEMPT FEE_VENDOR EDI_VENDOR PO_HOLD NEW_PAY_HOLD ALL_PAY_HOLD\n\n\nFields have no value will not appear in the out array\n\nErrors: If an error should occur during the query, the node out("ERROR")\nwill be set. There are two special cases:\n\nNetwork timeout - In this case, out("ERROR")="NETWORK TIMEOUT"\n\nNo Selection - If the user does not select a vendor (e.g., by exiting by\ntyping "^") it will be the case that out("ERROR")="NO SELECTION"\n\nIn all other cases, out("ERROR") will be set to the error message returned\nby CoreFLS or possibly to a value indicating an internal error in the\nCommunications Service Library (the specific value being a string\nindicating the nature of the error).\n\nCaveat: Note that the vendor query API does not clear the out variable, so\nit is best to explicitly NEW this variable (which should be namespaced)\nbefore making the call.\n	VENQ

3782	Vendor Update API	R	CSLVQ	0	Vendor Update API\n\nThe vendor update operates asynchronously using a callback model. The\nfirst step in running the vendor update is to build a (typically global)\narray containing the vendor ID, site ID and modification date for each\nvendor to be updated. In addition to the asynchronous (background) entry\npoint, there is a synchronous (foreground) call that may be used to\ninteractively retrieve the full set of attributes that would be returned\nfor a vendor using the background update. The foregound call involves no\nmodification date, and returns the vendor attributes unconditionally.\n\nThe format of the array is\n\n...\nARRAY(index) = vendor_id^site_id^timestamp\n...\n\n(where timestamp is in Fileman format).\n\nNote: The timestamp will be the value previously received from CoreFLS,\nnot the time the local file was updated or any other timestamp generated\nwithin VistA.\n\nExample:\n\n^TMP(4375,1)="ACME_DRUGS_AND_SUPPLIES^SAN_FRANCISCO_2^3021008.191213"\n^TMP(4375,2)="PEERLESS_AMBULANCE_CO^ATLANTA_7^3020721.1542"\n\nThe name of this array (not a reference) will be one parameter to the\nvendor update.\n\nExample:\n\nIn this case, the array name is $NA(^TMP(4375)), or simply "^TMP(4375)".\n\nThe second parameter will be an entry point to user supplied routine in\nthe format "ENTRY^ROUTINE" (i.e., no parameters will be listed). The\nactual call is\n\nD UPDATE^CSLVQ(ARRAY,"ENTRY^ROUTINE")\n\nThe array passed as the first parameter may safely be KILLed by the caller\nat any point after this call returns.\n\nIf an error occurs, CSLERR will be set a value in the format\n"errno^description".\n\nThe callback has one parameter, the name of an array containing one or\nmore vendor records. The format of the array is\n\nARRAY(index, field_subscript) = value\n\nException: Index value 0 is reserved for system use, so ARRAY(0, ...) must\nnot be treated as data. Typically, data will be stored under numeric\nsubscripts starting with 1.\n\nThe possible values of field_subscript are\n\n\nVENDOR_ID\nVENDOR_NAME\nTAX_ID\nINACTIVE_DATE [1]\nAREA_CODE\nPHONE_NO\nFAX_AREA_CODE\nFAX_NO\nADDRESS_LINE_1\nADDRESS_LINE_2\nADDRESS_LINE_3\nCITY\nSTATE\nCOUNTY\nPOSTAL_CODE\nCOUNTRY\nVENDOR_SITE\nCHAIN_NO\nCOMMENTS [2]\nLAST_UPDATED [1]\nPARTICIPATION_CODE\nVENDOR_TYPE\nTYPE_OF_VENDOR\nMEDICARE_ID\nSPECIALTY_CODE\nNO_OF_BEDS\nINSPECTED/ACCREDITED\nLAST_ASSESSMENT [1]\nCERTIFIED_MEDICARE/MEDICAID\nON_HOLD\nFEE_VENDOR\n\nNotes:\n\n[1] Dates are Fileman format\n\n[2] A word-processing field will be stored in the format\n\n\n\nSUBARRAY(1,0)=line 1 SUBARRAY(2,0)=line 2\n...\n\nFor example, the comments field might be stored as\n\n^TMP(1,34567830,"COMMENTS",1,0)="Line 1 of comments\n^TMP(1,34567830,"COMMENTS",2,0)="Line 2 of comments\n\n\nIn addition, there are a number of optional vendor attributes. If an\nattribute is present, the appropriate top level subscript will be set. For\nexample, for an EDI vendor, we will have\n\nARRAY(index,"EDI_VENDOR")=1\n\nThe complete list of attribute subscripts is\n\n\n\n\nON_HOLD PRIMARY_PAY_TO RFQ PURCHASING PAY_TO PROCUREMENT_CARD\nPRICER_EXEMPT FEE_VENDOR EDI_VENDOR PO_HOLD NEW_PAY_HOLD ALL_PAY_HOLD\n\n\n\nWARNING\n\nIt is the responsibility of the user supplied routine to file the data,\nperforming any necessary locking. It is important to be aware that this\nroutine can be called at any time, and it is possible for it to be called\nany number of background tasks running concurrently.\n\nA second entry point ("interactive update") exists as a convenience to the\nuser/programmer. This entry point is an extrinsic function ($$IUPDT^CSLVQ)\ntaking the vendor ID and vendor site name as parameters and returning he\nname of an array containing the vendor attributes (in the same format). In\nthis case, no date of last update is supplied, and the vendor data is\nreturned unconditionally.\n	UPDATE	UPDATE	IUPDT

3834	CSL Cost Center table update	R	CSLEC	0	With the replacement of IFCAP by the CoreFLS system, the lookup of a Cost\nCenter value will be done through a local Cost Center file. This file will\nbe updated by Event Capture once a year or as needed through a query to\nretrieve active cost centers from the CoreFLS system.\n\nAccording to VA handbook 4671.1, cost center codes from 8000** through\n8999** will cover all possible VHA activities. The cost center file update\nquery will issue a request to the CoreFLS system to transmit all cost\ncenter codes which start with an 8 (8*****) to VistA.\n\nThe CC table update query function call provided to the subscriber will\nreturn a value of 1 indicating the query sent to CoreFLS system was\nsuccessful, or a 0 to indicate the query failed. Example:\n\nS X=$$CCTBL^CSLEC()    to send CC table update query to CoreFLS system\n\nAfter CC table update query is received by the CoreFLS system, an HL7\nmessage containing all the cost center codes that start with an 8 (8*****)\nwill be generated and transmitted to VistA for processing. The HL7 package\nin VistA will invoke routine CSLEC1 to parse the HL7 message and store the\nmost recent active cost center codes into table 536.3. Before the table is\nupdated, the active flag for all cost center codes in the table will be\nchanged to 0 (inactive). If an existing cost center is included in the HL7\nmessage received, the active flag will be updated to 1 (active).\n\nTo prevent table 536.3 from being partially updated while processing the\nHL7 messages, the data will be parsed to a temparary file ^XTMP first then\nto the file 536.3.\n\nIn order to decide whether the CC table update is successful or not, the\nsubscriber need to check the 5 parameters provided by the CC table update\nquery. The following 5 parameters will be defined in file 8989.51 through\nthe pre-install routine, CSLEC2, when the CSL package is installed at site\nfor the first time. The value of these parameters are stored in file\n8989.5 and will be updated each time the CC table update query is invoked.\n\n1. CSL CC UPDATE REQUEST   (store the query request date)\n2. CSL CC UPDATE START     (store the table update start date)\n3. CSL CC UPDATE END       (store the table update end date)\n4. CSL CC UPDATE STATUS    (1: processing, 0: completed)\n5. CSL CC UPDATE NOTE      (store status note)\n\nThe following logic decide whether the update is successful or not:\n\nIf Request date > Start date\nStart date > End date             table partially updated and\ndata is not usable\nStart date <= End date            table not updated but data is\nusable.\n\nIf Request date <= Start date\nStart date > End date             table partially updated and data\nis not usable.\nStart date <= End date            table updated successfully\n\n	CCTBL

3857	PATIENT SECURITY CHECK	R	DGSEC	0	The Record Tracking package has several NOIS calls indicating that the\npatient sensitivity/security check is no longer being done on patient\nlookups.\n\nThis problem surfaced after DG*5.3*223 was released on May 1, 2000. Prior\nto that release, the patient security/sensitivity check was done as part\nof the post-selection process when looking up a patient on the Patient\nFile #2 using File Manager.  DG/223 prevented this check if the DIC(0)\nvariable contained an "I" which was the case for CIRN.  Record Tracking\nalso contains an "I" when doing these lookups, therefore the security\ncheck stopped being done.\n\nThe solution is to call ^DGSEC from two routines: RTB for normal patient\nlookup RTDPA for lookup using bar code scanner\n	DGSEC

3983	DBIA3983	G	GMR(123,	123	Patch TIU*1*144, CONSULTS WITH MISMATCHED PATIENTS, generates a list of\nTIU Consult documents whose patient differs from the patient of the\nassociated Consult Request.  The site is asked to clean up the patient\nmismatches for these documents.  So far as we know, the software errors\nwhich created these mismatches have all been corrected, so we expect this\ncleanup effort to be a one-time effort, though it may take the site some\ntime.\n\nWhen displaying these documents in a list, TIU needs to provide enough\ninformation on each document for the site to identify and locate the\ndocument and the associated Consult Request.  For this, TIU needs to read\nfields .02, 1, 5, and 8.\n\nAlso, TIU needs to identify on the list any documents which are linked on\nthe Consults side with a request in addition to or different from the\nrequest with which the document is linked on the TIU side. So far as we\nknow, this situation occurs only when sites have edited file GMR(123 with\nFileMan. It causes the appropriate TIU cleanup action, LINK WITH REQUEST,\nto misbehave.  In such cases, the patch asks sites to request help from\nNVS. For this, TIU needs to read the "R" cross-reference on field 50,\nASSOCIATED RESULTS.\n^GMR(123,\n.02      PATIENT NAME         0;2      Read w/Fileman\n1        TO SERVICE           0;5      Read w/Fileman\n8        CPRS STATUS          0;12     Read w/Fileman\n5        URGENCY              0;9      Read w/Fileman\n^GMR(123,'R',\n

3988	Dynamic Routing Header Help Code	R	HLCSHDR4	0	The Dynamic Routing patch HL*1.6*93 gives application developers writing\ncalls to the VistA HL7 package's DIRECT^HLMA and GENERATE^HLMA APIs the\nability to directly control the routing-related fields.  These fields are\nthe SENDING APPLICATION (MSH-3), SENDING FACILITY (MSH-4), RECEIVING\nAPPLICATION (MSH-5), and the RECEIVING FACILITY (MSH-6).\n\nRefer to chapter 12 of the VistA HL7 Site Manager and Developer manual for\ncomplete information about the use of the DIRECT^HLMA and the\nGENERATE^HLMA APIs.\n\nThe Dynamic Routing patch HL*1.6*93 expands the data that can be passed\ninto these APIs to include HLP("SUBSCRIBER") and HLP("SUBSCRIBER",n) local\narray entries. When passing HLP("SUBSCRIBER") or HLP("SUBSCRIBER",n) local\narray data, an M API created by the application developer can be called to\nevaluate the environment and, if appropriate, change the local variables\nused to create the routing-related fields in the MSH segment.\n\nA new API, M^HLCSHDR4, has been created to assist application developers\nin the early stages of using M code to control the routing-related fields\nin the MSH segment.\n\nWhen the HLP("SUBSCRIBER") or HLP("SUBSCRIBER",n) local array data\nreferences M^HLCSHDR4, this is how M^HLCSHDR4 is executed, and the actions\ntaken:\n\nStep  Action and Comments\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#1   DIRECT^HLMA or GENERATE^HLMA is called, with HLP("SUBSCRIBER") or\nHLP("SUBSCRIBER",n) local array defined with a reference to\nM^HLCSHDR4.\n#2   Execution of DIRECT^HLMA or GENERATE^HLMA code proceeds, coming to\nthe code that creates the MSH segment.\n#3   The HLP("SUBSCRIBER") and HLP("SUBSCRIBER",n) data is evaluated, and\nthe call to M^HLCSHDR4 is found.\n#4   M^HLCSHDR4 is called, and the following actions occur:\n- The local variables that will be used in the creation of the\nrouting-related fields in the MSH segment are displayed,\naccompanied with explanation of each variable, it's significance,\nand from what source the variable was created.\n- Application developer can interactively enter new values for the\nrouting-related fields.\n- If new values are entered, the application developer is informed\non-screen the actions taken by M^HLCSHDR4 based on the newly\nentered value for the routing-related field(s).  (I.e., the\nlocal variable(s) used in the creation of the routing-related\nfields is reset to the new value entered by the developer.)\n#5   The MSH segment is built using the routing-related\nlocal variables, (some of which might have been interactively\nchanged by the developer when answering the M^HLCSHDR4 queries.)\n#6   Execution of DIRECT^HLMA or GENERATE^HLMA code proceeds, the MSH\nsegment and the complete message is created, and all processing of\nthe message completes.\n\nBecause of the display of explanatory information by M^HLCSHDR4, and\nbecause the developer is informed of the actions being taken in resetting\nthe routing-related variables, this API is a valuable training tool.\n\nApplication developers calling M code via HLP("SUBSCRIBER") or\nHLP("SUBSCRIBER",n) are encouraged to use the M^HLCSHDR4 API during the\ninitial phases of their development.  After learning how to use M code to\ncontrol the routing-related fields in the MSH segment, developers must\nremove the educational M^HLCSHDR4 reference, substituting their own M code\nAPI.\n	M

Both have\nidentical parameters and both return data in the same format.  The only\ndifference is that $$CM^HLUCM returns the number of messages during the\nuser-supplied time range, and $$CM2^HLUCM returns the number of "message\nunits" within a time range.\n\nMessages are individually transmitted messages.  The initially transmitted\nmessage is considered a "message" by $$CM^HLUCM, and the return\nacknowledgement is considers a separate and unique "message."  If a\nmessage is transmitted, and an acknowledgement message returned,\n$$CM^HLUCM returns a total of two messages.\n\nMessage "units" are collections of functionally related messages.  In the\nabove example, $$CM^HLUCM counts two messages, but since the message and\nit's acknowledgement are functionally related, $$CM2^HLUCM returns a count\nof one "unit."\n\n$$CM2F^HLUCM counts message units in an identical manner to $$CM2.  The\nonly difference between these two APIs is the $$CM2F^HLUCM counts only\nmessage units involving remote sites.  $$CM2^HLUCM (and $$CM^HLUCM, for\nthat matter) counts both locally and remotely sent message units.\n	CM2F

It is requested that as part of the Legacy\nSoftware Shut Down process, PRCL namespaced code be allowed to set the\nDOMAIN file (#4.2) entry's FLAGS field (#1) to 'C' (CLOSED) and delete the\ncurrent value of the RELAY DOMAIN field (#2) for the following domains:\nCONST.RD4-REGION4.VA.GOV\nNESC.MED.VA.GOV\nQ-CRD.VA.GOV\nQ-EDP.VA.GOV\nQ-EDV.MED.VA.GOV\nQ-FAM.VA.GOV\nQ-FMZ.VA.GOV\nQ-ISM.VA.GOV\nQ-LOG.VA.GOV\nQ-PRC.VA.GOV\n\nBefore filing the changes, the current values of those domains/queues will\nbe extracted and stored in the LEGACY SOFTWARE SHUT DOWN file (#449.1), so\nthat they are available for restoration if necessary.  As part of this\nintegration agreement, we are also requesting that the software be\npermitted to file the original values back into the DOMAIN file entries,\nin the remote likelihood that the CoreFLS implementation needs to be\ntemporarily reversed.\n\nThe extraction of current values and the filing would be performed by\ncalls to supported FileMan database server APIs.\n
4142	Entry Action Setting in Option	G	DIC(19,	19	As part of the Legacy Software Shut Down process, IFCAP, Engineering\n(AEMS/MERS) and Equipment/Turn-In Request options that change the database\nwill be disabled.  Only read access to the database will be allowed once\nthe site comes up on CoreFLS. Although putting a string in the OUT OF\nORDER MESSAGE field (#2) can put the option offline, it seems preferable\nto also inactivate the option by putting "S XQUIT=1" in the ENTRY ACTION\nfield (#20).  There currently is not a supported Kernel API specifically\nfor editing the ENTRY ACTION field. Management has previously instructed\nour team not to edit the application routines in order to inactivate the\noption.\n\nSpecifically this request is to permit PRCL namespaced code to file "S\nXQUIT=1" in the ENTRY ACTION field of selected options of these three\nlegacy packages using supported FileMan (FM) database server APIs.  Before\nfiling the new value, the existing value will be extracted via a FM\nsupported API and stored in the LEGACY SOFTWARE SHUT DOWN file (#449.1) so\nthat it is available if needed.  In the remote possibility the the site\ntemporarily needs to resume business activity in the legacy systems, it is\nalso requested that the software be permitted to restore the original\nvalue for each entry again using supported FM APIs.  [Note: The software\nis also filing of an Out of Order Message using the supported\nOUT^XPDMENU() API.]\n
4143	Scheduled Option Removal	G	DIC(19.2,	19.2	The Legacy Software Shut Down project will be converting the IFCAP,\nEngineering (AEMS/MERS) and Equipment/Turn-In Request packages to\nRead-Only as part of the site's coming on line with CoreFLS.  Scheduled\noptions, especially those which may alter the database, must be removed\nfrom the OPTION SCHEDULING file (#19.2).  This request is to permit PRCL\nnamespaced code to remove any entries in the namespaces of these legacy\npackages from file 19.2.\n\nSpecifically it is requested that the Legacy Sofware Shut Down software be\npermitted to extract via supported FileMan database server APIs, the\ncurrent value of most fields of the entry to be removed so that they can\nbe stored in the LEGACY SOFTWARE SHUT DOWN file (#449.1) in case the\nvalues are needed later. The TASK ID field (#12) and the computed TASK\nDEFIND field (#99.1), however, will not be backed up.  The request further\nasks for permission to remove the entry from file 19.2 via a ^DIK call.\nFinally, in the highly unlikely event that the site must temporarily\nresume using these packages, instead of CoreFLS, for business activities,\nit is requested that the software be permitted to create a new entry in\nfile 19.2 to reschedule each of the affected options.  This again would be\naccomplished through supported FileMan APIs.  TaskManager, not this\nsoftware, would establish the value for the TASK ID field.\n
4144	Dequeueing Legacy Software Tasks	G	ZTSK(	14.4	The Legacy Software Shut Down patch will be converting the IFCAP,\nEngineering (AEMS/MERS) and Equipment/Turn-In Request packages to\nRead-Only when the site comes up on CoreFLS.  Queued tasks for these\npackages, especially those that may alter the database, must be dequeued.\nSpecifically, this request asks that PRCL namespaced software be permitted\nto $Order() through the ^%ZTSK global and to identify tasks to be dequeued\nthrough examination by direct global read of the Routine Name field (#2)\n[node 0, piece 2], comparing the routine's prefix to the namespaces of the\nabove packages.  (For dequeueing, the status of the task must also be\nverified as "Active: Pending" using the supported Kernel API\nSTAT^%ZTLOAD.) Where the task is to be dequeued via supported Kernel API\nDQ^%ZTLOAD, it is requested that the software be permitted to file via a\nsupported FileMan database server API a value of one year from the run\ndate into the Remember Untill field (#59.8) so that the task is still\navailable, in the highly unlikely case that the site needs to temporarily\nresume business processing using these legacy packages instead of CoreFLS\nand wishes to requeue the task.  Finally, for reporting tasks dequeued as\npart of the shut down, it is requested that the software be permitted to\nextract via a supported FileMan database server API, the values for the\nEntry Point field (#.01), Routine Name field (#2) and the Task Description\nfield (#41), so they can be displayed in addition to the task number.\n
4145	Kernel Part 3 - Modifying File Access Permissions	G	VA(200,DUZ,'FOF',	200.032	The Legacy Software Shut Down patch will convert the IFCAP, Engineering\n(AEMS/MERS), and Equipment/Turn-In Request packages to Read-Only.  Users\nmust not be able to edit via FileMan, files of the above packages.\nAlthough some restriction can be accomplished by the IRM removing Write\nand Delete/Purge permissions to application namespaced globals, some\nEngineering files still store data in the ^DIC global, whose protection\ncan not be changed by this patch. In addition, as a temporary workaround\nfor Prosthetics during the initial deployment of CoreFLS at VAMC Bay\nPines, the protection of the IFCAP ^PRC global can not be modified so\naccess to files stored in this global has to be controlled via VA FileMan\nor Kernel Part 3 setups.  This request concerns sites that have\nimplemented the Kernel Part 3 access controls.\n\nSpecifically, this request asks that PRCL namespaced code be permitted to\n$Order() through the AFOF cross reference in the NEW PERSON file (#200) in\norder to identify individuals with access to the files of interest and the\ninternal number of the accessible file multiple entry.  It is further\nrequested that the software be permitted to extract via a supported\nFileMan API, the current access values in case they are needed later. They\nwill be stored in the LEGACY SOFTWARE SHUT DOWN file (#449.1).  It is\nrequested that the software be permitted to file via a supported FileMan\nAPI, '0' (NO) for DATA DICTIONARY ACCESS, DELETE ACCESS, LAYGO ACCESS, and\nWRITE ACCESS to the files of these packages.  Finally, in the highly\nunlikely situation that users need to temporarily resume using these\nlegacy packages, rather than CoreFLS for their business activities, it is\nrequested that the software be permitted to file via a supported FileMan\nAPI, the original values back into the ACCESSIBLE FILE multiple of the NEW\nPERSON entries that were modified during the shut down.\n

4336	AP Status Update 			0	AP Status Update\n\nPurpose:  To transmit a message from CoreFLS to VistA Prosthetics when a\nvalue on a Prosthetics Purchase Order has been changed, either because of\nan Invoice transaction, a price or quantity change on a PO. or a\nreconciliation of a line item or the cancellation of a PO or the\ncompletion of a PO.\n\nBehavior:  There is no user prompting in this event.  All information is\ntransmitted by CoreFLS.  When the event occurs, a message is sent to VistA\nProsthetics via CSL.  Upon receipt, an Application Acknowledgement ACK or\nNAK is returned to CoreFLS.\n\nInformation is transmitted from CoreFLS in an HL7 format specified as "AP\nStatus Update Event from CoreFLS".  Incoming information is read by\nroutines ~CSLPRUP and ~CSLPRUPA.  If the Order Status Field is "CA", the\nmessage is considered a cancellation of the entire PO; otherwise, the\nmessage is a transmission of a change to a specific line on a specified\nPO.\n\nInformation that is transmitted from CoreFLS is put into an ^XTMP global\nfor use by VistA Prosthetics.\n\nThe CSL routine calls a VistA routine, EN~RMPRCSL1(CSLSUB,.ERRAY), passing\nthe complete node structure of "CSLAPUP" concatenated with the Message\nControl ID, for processing, plus any content or format errors that the CSL\ncode has identified.\n\nNOTE:  Quantity Invoiced and Invoice Line Amount are assumed to be\ntransmitted from CoreFLS as running totals for the line item on the PO.\nThis means that if 15 units were ordered and they were invoiced as they\narrived as 1, 2, 3, 4 then 5 items, there would be 5 AP Status Update\nmessages.  The first would reflect a quantity of 1, the second would be 3,\nthe third would 6, the fourth would be 10, and the fifth would be 15.\n\nIf the message transmitted is a cancellation of a complete Purchase Order,\nthe CSL process branches to ~CSLPRUPC to develop the ~XTMP global with\nless data in the global but with the same structure.   CSL invokes the\nsame processing routine for sending information to VistA Prosthetics.\n\nThe CSL routine evaluates the data sent by CoreFLS for the following\nstructure and content:\n\nPO Number longer than 20 characters Quantity Ordered not numeric PO Line\nnumber not numeric ACS longer than 200 characters Quantity Invoiced not\nnumeric Purchase card longer than 80 characters PO Line ID not numeric\nUnit price not numeric Vendor Number longer than 30 characters Vendor Site\nlonger than 15 characters Update Date not formatted correctly Line\nCancelled Quantity not numeric Invoice Line Amount not numeric Order Line\nAmount not numeric\n\nAfter VistA Prosthetics processes the supplied information, if an error is\ndetected, an error message is returned to CSL in sub-node 5 of the ~XTMP\nglobal.  This causes an Application NAK to be transmitted to CoreFLS for\nevaluation and reprocessing.  If no errors are detected, either by CSL or\nby VistA Prosthetics, then an Application Acknowledgement ACK is sent from\nCSL to CoreFLS.  This completes the activities for AP Status Update\n

4851	KAAJEE			0	KAAJEE addresses the Authentication and Authorization (AA) needs of\nHealtheVet-VistA Web-based applications in the J2EE environment.\n\nMost major J2EE application servers (e.g., BEA WebLogic V. 8.1 [SP4 or\nhigher] and Oracle's 9iAS) allow enterprises to override the default\nsource of AA and replace it with custom, enterprise-specific sources for\nAA.  In order to rapidly develop an AA solution for HealtheVet-VistA\nweb-based applications without creating a new enterprise user store,\nKAAJEE takes full advantage of this feature of creating a custom solution.\nThis enables KAAJEE to provide a solution that has a similar look-and-feel\nof what VistA users are currently accustomed to.\n\nKAAJEE authenticates against a VistA M Server first with Access and Verify\ncodes via VistALink's AV connection spec (i.e.,\nKaajeeVistaLinkConnectionSpec). After the user has been properly\nauthenticated against a VistA M Server, KAAJEE dynamically creates a\ntemporary username and password and populates this into a Structured Query\nLanguage (SQL) database via custom Security Service Provider Interfaces\n(SSPIs). This username and password is needed for the second\nlevel/phase/pass authentication for the J2EE container.\n\nCurrently, Kernel maintains the primary HealtheVet-VistA user store (i.e.,\nNEW PERSON file [#200]), and provides both Authentication and\nAuthorization (AA) services for all HealtheVet-VistA applications. By\nleveraging Kernel, KAAJEE aims to authenticate and authorize J2EE Web\nusers to their applications using Kernel's AA capabilities.\n\n

4976	Patient Service Construct java components			0	Patient Service Construct is a Veterans Health Information Systems and\nTechnology Architecture (VistA) re-engineering project based on the Java\ntechnologies.  Patient Service is a composite business service that\nprovides a broad range of high-level patient administrative data.  The\ndata is based on access to the individual business services such as\nPatient Demographics, Eligibility/Enrollment, and Patient Identification,\nwhich serve as authoritative sources for that data.  For those\napplications that have been re-engineered, all needs to retrieve patient\nadministrative data through a common business service will be met.  The\nPatient Service Construct functionality is invisible to existing M VistA\napplications.\n\nPSC provides a CAIP compliant delegate (IPatientServiceDelegate) for\napplications to use that has two main API s, retrievePatientData\n(IPatientServiceRequest) and retrieveMultiplePatients(IPatientService\nRequest, String[]) where the array of strings is an array of ICN values.\nThe delegate accesses the patient data through a session fagade EJB.  It\nis the responsibility of the calling application to instantiate the EJB in\nan application server for its use. The data is retrieved at the specified\nVistA location through the session fagade utilizing VistaLink.  The\nIPatientServiceRequest must contain the necessary information to complete\nthe task.\n\nThis integration agreement documents the APIs provided by Patient Service\nConstruct.\n

5251	Use of Routine MPIHLO2	R	MPIHLO2	0	Master Patient Index (Austin) is requesting permission from the\nHL7 developers to establish a private, temporary IA to use routine\nMPIHLO2.  This HL7 routine was provided by the HL7 developers, to\nbe installed as MPIHLO2 on the Master Patient Index (Austin).\nThe routine will be directly removing entries from an existing\nsequence queue (^HLB("QUEUE","SEQUEUNCE","MPI LKMV") global and\nplacing them on an existing out queue (^HLB("QUEUE","OUT") with\nthe use of the OUTQUE^HLOQUE API (for more details see the routine\nbelow).  The code also resets the ^HLC status global as well.\n\nThe need for this request came from the System-of-System (SoS)\ngroup to help address the critical backlog of messages on the\nMPI HLO MPI LKMV sequence queue to PSIM.  The ESR project is\nscheduled to go live on 8/15/08.  In order to accomplish this,\nit would require that the MPI HLO queues not have a backlog of\nmessages.  However the current backlog of messages on the MPI\nwill not be finished at the current rate with the current\nsoftware until 9/20/08.\n\nThe use of routine MPIHLO2 is a temporary measure that will take\nall of the ADD events that are currently stacked up on one outbound\nqueue (Adds/Links/Moves queue) to PSIM and move them directly to the\noutbound queue which will allow them to be processed simultaneously\nin PSIM rather than one at a time.  The implementation will guarantee\nthat the two databases (MPI and ADR) will stay synchronized by\nshutting down the EVENT sequence queue (Add/Link/Move) until all of\nthe ADD events are sent and successfully processed by PSIM.  Then\nand only then will we resume normal processing.\n\nThis routine will only be used a few times (at most for only a few\nmonths).  After that we plan to retire it for a more permanent\nsolution to address the MPI to PSIM synchronization throughput issue.\n\nNOTE:  Although routine MPIHLO2 was provided/reviewed by the HL7\ndevelopers, testing and SQA is the sole responsibility of the\nMaster Patient Index development team.\n	MPIHLO2

5255	PRIVATE ICR FOR CISS TO ACCESS KAAJEE			0	1. Logins are only to be performed by the CISS framework code.  This\nIA and supporting IAs are granted to CISS only, not to the application\nportlets/plug-ins running in CISS.\n\n2. To run user checks and establish user identity for a specific M/VistA\nsystem, CISS should do the following:\n\na. Instantiate a KaajeeVistaLinkConnectionSpec instance, using\nuser-entered access/verify code and division, and also obtaining the\nend-user's IP address, e.g., request.getRemoteAddr().\n\nb. Obtain a VistALink connection to the desired M/VistA system from the\nappropriate VistaLink connection factory object, using the\nKaajeeVistaLinkConnectionSpec instance.\n\nc. Using the connection, run the RPC "XUS KAAJEE GET USER INFO" in the\nRPC context "XUS SIGNON" to, if successful, get a DUZ back.\nThis also creates the sign-on log entry on the M/VistA system; the DA\nof that entry is also returned. If an exception is thrown, the user\nis not authorized to run RPCs on the target VistA system. The exception\nwill contain the reason for denial.\n\nd. If the end-user is authorized to run RPCs by the preceding step,\nuse the same connection and immediately run the RPC "XUS KAAJEE LOGOUT"\nunder the RPC context "XUS SIGNON", passing the DA of the sign-on log\nentry created.  Running the RPC marks the sign-on log entry as closed.\n\ne. Close the connection.\n\nf. To run application RPCs for the end user, obtain a new connection\nfrom the same VistALink connection factory, but using\nVistaLinkDuzConnectionSpec (or, when supported,\nVistaLinkVpidConnectionSpec.)\n\n3. For the duration of the user session, the DUZ may be used with\nDuzConnectionSpec to run RPCs.\n\n4. Whether or not CISS caches a user's DUZ, for any new CISS user\nsessions requiring access to a VistA system, all steps 2a-2f should be\nperformed again, as the user's authorization to log onto the VistA system\nmay have been revoked or otherwise may have changed since the previous\nsession.\n\n

It is to be used prior to obtaining connection(s) from a given\nVistaLinkConnectionFactory instance.\n\n3. It is to be used only to retrieve the introductory text from the target\nM/VistA system for the purposes of supporting login functionality to the\ntarget M/VistA system.\n\n4.

The Ward Clerk\nMenu option will be used by the HRC contact representatives and\ndistributed in patch DVBA*2.7*148. The HRC has provided the following\njustification for access to the Ward Clerk Menu option:\n\nThe request for the VistA option Ward Clerk Menu [OR MAIN MENU WARD CLERK]\nwill provide additional functionality to flag renewal requests for\nprovider action. Renewal of prescriptions that have expired or have no\nrefills remaining constitute 26.1% of the call fielded by the HRC Pharmacy\nCustomer Care Center (PCCC). This type of call cannot be easily resolved\nby the facility pharmacies, because action on the part of the provider is\nrequired. With access to the option, the HRC agent can send a "View Alert"\ndirectly to the provider through VistA.  The provider will receive the\n"View Alert" immediately upon being flagged by the HRC agent to ensure\nprompt attention and resolution of the required prescription renewal.\nSafeguards are built into the Ward Clerk version of the VistA option not\nallowing the HRC PCCC agent to discontinue, copy, change or renew a\nprescription without verification by a facility clinician. CAPRI does\nrecognize credentials so the renewals flagged by HRC agents would not be\nprocessed until signed off by the provider.\n

5746	USE SCREENMAN DDS VARIABLE			0	The ScreenMan documentation recommends that applications use $D(DDS) to\ndetermine if their code is being executed from within a ScreenMan form.\nReading the contents of ScreenMan's DDS variable allows application\ndevelopers to determine the ScreenMan form their code is being invoked\nfrom. The format of DDS is formIEN^formName. This ICR allows reading of\nDDS variable.\n\nIn order for an application to integrate and simultaneously use the\nBrowser, List Manager, and ScreenMan the application must be able to\nmanipulate the DDS variable. If List Manager is invoked from ScreenMan\nList Manager prompts will not display correctly because ^DIR works\ndifferently when DDS is defined. Therefore the application must save DDS\nand kill it before calling List Manager and restore it when returning from\nList Manager to ScreenMan. If the Browser is invoked from List Manager and\nDDS is not defined because of the above situation then the Browser will\nkill on exit some of variables needed by ScreenMan. Therefore the\napplication needs to temporarily set DDS=1 before invoking the Browser.\n\nIn summary, this ICR allows the application to read, kill, set, and NEW\nthe DDS variable.\n\nNote that if List Manager is being invoked from ScreenMan the following\nKernel calls should be made to restore the terminal settings required by\nScreenMan before calling REFRESH^DDSUTL.\n\nN IOAWMO,X         S X=0 X ^%ZOSF("RM"),^%ZOSF("TYPE-AHEAD") S X="IOAWM0"\nD ENDR^%ZISS W IOAWM0\n\nIf this is not done the ScreenMan display will be corrupted.\n\n

5773	ICD-9/ICD-10 Lookup			0	Applications may conduct Fileman lookups of ICD Diagnosis file #80 and the\nICD OPERATIONS/PROCEDURE file #80.1 using ^DIC and the Special Lookup\nroutine ICDEXLK.  Applications may also point to these files.\n\nA special lookup program was written for the ICD DIAGNOSIS file #80 and\nICD OPERATION/PROCEDURE file #80.1 to navigate through the versioned (date\nsensitive) data stored in these files.  The Name of the special lookup is\nstored in the Data Dictionary for these files:\n\n^DD(80,0,"DIC")="ICDEXLK"\n^DD(80.1,0,"DIC")="ICDEXLK"\n\nEach time an application makes a ^DIC call to either file 80 or 80.1, the\nspecial lookup routine is invoked, provided the FileMan variable DIC(0)\ndoes not contain an "I" for "ignore the special lookup."\n\nNOTE: Only the ^DIC call honors the special lookup routine. Those calls\nthat allow the user to specify the indexes (IX^DIC and MIX^DIC1), and the\nData Base Server calls (FIND^DIC, $$FIND1^DIC, and UPDATE^DIE) all ignore\nthe Special Lookup Program.  As a result, the FileMan calls that ignore\nthe Special Lookup Program will not be able to conduct versioned searches\nor return versioned data so use IX^DIC, MIX^DIC1 FIND^DIC, and $$FIND1^DIC\nwith a great deal of care.  Never use any FileMan entry point that alters\nthe data in these files (i.e., ^DIE, EN^DIB, ^DIK FILE^DIE, UPDATE^DIE and\nFILE^DICN)\n\nPackage Special Lookup Variables\n\nThe following local variables in the ICD namespace should be NEWed\nor KILLed by the calling application.  The global variables may\nbe used in instances where local environment variables get NEWed\nand the special lookup values need to be retained.

STS will find the\nappropriate mapping issued by the National Library of Medicine (NLM) and\ndeploy that mapping using NTRT. When the NTRT deployment finishes, the\nClinical Lexicon application will call SCTMAP^GMPLX1 to update all\ninstances in the PROBLEM file where the SNOMED CT concept has been filed\nwith the ICD-9-CM code of 799.9, replacing the non-specific Diagnosis with\nthe newly mapped ICD-9-CM code.\n\nNOTE: This API will be updated in GMPL*2*42 to accommodate either SNOMED\nCT-to-ICD-9-CM or SNOMED CT-to-ICD-10-CM mappings.\n	SCTMAP

On the form, they have "DSS Units" drop down box.\nIn the drop down box, MHV needs to present to Provider all the active DSS\nUnits that he/she has access to.  To fill the drop down box, MHV calls an\nMHV RPC called "MHV GETDSSUNIT" which has logic to retrieve provider's\nassigned DSS Units and their associated fields (Name, Inactive, SEND to\nPCE flag).  "MHV GETDSSUNIT" sends DSS units back to frontend which uses\nthem to populate drop down box.  Then provider can select one of those DSS\nUnits to file workload. Three conditions need to be satisfied before DSS\nUnit can be presented to provider 1. DSS Unit must be active.  2. Provider\nshould have that DSS Unit in the assigned (MHV) list of DSS Units.  3. DSS\nUnit should also be associated with Location (Associated clinic) selected\nin front-end MHV GETDSSUNIT RPC checks for these three conditions and\nsends back DSS Units that pass this criteria.

6042	SCMC PCMM/R GET PRIMARY CARE SUMMARY	R	SCMCWSUT	0	This is a new API developed for PCMMR that will return Patient Aligned\nCare Team (PACT) summary data for a patient.  This information will\ninclude site name, PACT name, Primary Care Provider (PCP) and Associate\nProvider (AP) names.  PCMMR will keep this data current.  It will be\nstored in the Outpatient Profile (404.41) file in the CPRS Header Text\n(.06) field.\n	CPRSHEAD

If and only if the local VistA staff\nperforming the Local Merges chooses to accept and process this local data\nmerge, PCMMR will complete the data merge in its own enterprise database,\nenabling it to continue data synchronization with the VistA site. If VistA\nchooses to deny the merge request, or merge the patient data in the\nopposite direction, PCMMR can use the status in this file to adjust its\nbehavior accordingly.\n\nThe code queries field .05 MERGE STATUS to find the status of the merge\nprocess for each pair of duplicate records. If it finds value 3 - IN\nPROCESS, it starts polling VistA. It will poll VistA at increasing time\ninterval until we exceed the maximum polling limit (currently 5 days from\nstart of polling). If during polling it finds a value of 2 - MERGED, in a\nduplicate pair, the code processes the patient's data for the site and\nsends an application ack (acknowledgement) to MVI.\n\nThe file is accessed using a PCMMR restricted RPC "SCMC LISTER", which\nemploys a Fileman DBS API to retrieve data from File 15.  It is deployed\nas part of patch SD*5.3*603.\n^VA(15,D0)\n.01      RECORD1              0;1      Read w/Fileman\n.02      RECORD2              0;2      Read w/Fileman\n.03      STATUS               0;3      Read w/Fileman\n.04      MERGE DIRECTION      0;4      Read w/Fileman\n.05      MERGE STATUS         0;5      Read w/Fileman\n

This\nambiguity undermines the value of electronic transactions by requiring\nrepeated manual intervention.\n\nBoth the IB and BPS (e-Claims Mgmt) namespaces will be displaying the HPID\non various reports and screens, and BPS will need to be able to access the\nIB utility that was developed to find, validate and display the HPID for a\nparticular health plan.\n\nThe functions of IBCNHUT1 will return the HPID/OEID for an insurance\ncompany and validate that the HPID/OEID is in the correct format (10\nnumeric characters, 1st character is a 6 or 7 and the 10th character is\nthe Luhn check-digit).\n	HPD	HOD

6444	ADD THREE FIELDS TO INSTITUTION FILE#4	G	DIC(4,	4	The VA FileMan team would like to add three (3) new fields to the\nINSTITUTION file (#4).  The new fields will be used to support the\ndetermination of GMT and TimeZone offset based on a given Institution\nEntry.\n\nDescriptions:\n-------------\n\n4,800     LOCATION TIMEZONE      8;1 POINTER TO WORLD TIMEZONES FILE\n(#1.71)\nLAST EDITED:  AUG 10, 2016\nHELP-PROMPT:  Enter the timezone or '?' to list timezones\nDESCRIPTION:  This is the timeZone of this specific location.\n\n4,801     COUNTRY                8;2 POINTER TO COUNTRY CODE FILE\n(#779.004 )\nLAST EDITED:  AUG 15, 2016\nHELP-PROMPT:  Enter the country, or '?' to list countries\nDESCRIPTION:  Country of this location.\n\n4,802     TIMEZONE EXCEPTION     8;3 SET    '0' FOR SST Only;\nLAST EDITED:  AUG 09, 2016\nHELP-PROMPT:  Enter 0 if this is for Standard Time only.\nDESCRIPTION:  This location does not follow the TimeZone and\ncountry timeframe changes therefore only follows STANDARD time. Example:\nSome locations in the USA do not follow the change to DAYLIGHT SAVINGS but\nremain STANDARD all year long. Those locations would need this exception\ndefined.  Puerto Rico's TimeZone is Atlantic which is also used by Canada,\nDominican Republic, and Bermuda.  Canada and Bermuda change timeframes and\nPuerto Rico and Dominican Republic do not.  A location in Puerto Rico or\nDominican Republic would need to have the exception field set to SST only.\n\n----------\n\nThe three fields will be sent out to the sites via the VA FILEMAN patch\nDI*22.2*2.  We will only send the three fields (partial), not the entire\nInstitution DD in KIDS. These fields will be maintained via the FORUM\nprocess.\n
6445	DIUTC	R	DIUTC	0	This Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) API will convert a FileMan date/time\ninto Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) with a time zone offset based on various\ninput values entered by the user or the default institution in the DUZ(2)\nvariable.\n\nThe format of the default output will be a GMT represented in standard\nFileMan date/time format and an internal three digit time zone offset\nappended to the end.  The calculation for the internal offset is the\nexternal offset converted to minutes, then divided by 5, and then added to\n500.  So -07:00 is -420 minutes, then divided by 5 is -84, and added to\n500 is 416.\n\nThere may be other output variables based on the value of the EXT input\nparameter.  The details for the other output values are documented in the\n$$UTC variable below.\n\nTo determine the offset, the API needs to have a TimeZone and Country.\nThese values are determined using the following algorithm:\n\n1.      No optional input parameters are passed in.  The user's default\nInstitution will be used based on the DUZ(2) variable.  The TimeZone and\nCountry are determined by the new fields in the Institution file.\n\n2.      If only Institution is passed in as an input parameter, the\nTimeZone and Country are determined by the new fields in the Institution\nfile.\n\n3.      The TimeZone and Country parameters are both passed in as input\nparameters.\n\n\nThe UTC API will return an error for any of the following conditions:\n\n1.      If the TimeZone or Country cannot be determined from any of the\nmethods documented above, an error will be returned.\n\n2.      If the TimeZone parameter is passed in without Country parameter\nor the Country parameter is passed in without a TimeZone parameter, an\nerror will be returned.\n\n3.      If the Institution parameter is passed in with either the TimeZone\nor Country parameter, an error will be returned.\n\n4.      Once the TimeZone and Country are determined, they will be\nvalidated for consistency.  An error will be returned if they are\ninconsistent e.g. if user passes in TimeZone = "Australian Eastern Time"\nand Country="Mexico", the UTC API will return an error.\n	UTC

10113	MAILMAN: Message Text - Direct Entry	G	XMB(3.9,	3.9	Summary\n\nSites complain about the way their machines seems to slow down\nconsiderably when Austin DPC transmissions are created.  Large messages\nmay be created in a more efficient way than is being used by most\napplications.  Since all DHCP sites are mandated to migrate to Kernel 7.1\nby 12/01/93, all applications can now use this method of creating a\nmessage.\n\n\nTechnical Background\n\nThe simplest approach is probably the one people are using.  It is pretty\nstraight forward:\n\nLoad the text of a message into an array\nSet a couple of variables\nD ^XMD\n\nWith short messages, this is also fairly efficient if a local array is\nused.  However, when a large message is built, it usually must be stored\nin a global array.  Then, MailMan must read it and re-write it.  This\neffectively doubles the amount of work the system must do to compile the\ntext of the message.  The killing of the temporary global array built to\nstore the data passed to the MailMan programmer interface eats up\nadditional resources.\n\nSo why not write the text of the message (the data) directly into the\nmessage, especially now that it is possible and that all the entry points\nhave been made available and are documented?  Examine the examples on the\nfollowing lines.\nExample\n\nThe following steps assume that the standard variables already exist in\nthe partition from either Log-on or because the job is a TaskMan task.\n\nStep 1  --  Create a Message with No Text\n\nS XMSUB="LARGE DATA TRANSMISSION";     Initialize Subject S\nXMDUZ="Application X"          ;     Sender D GET^XMA2\n;     Call Create Message Module\nSee Note 1 below!\nI XMZ<1 G RETRY        ;       Abort or retry, if returned value <1\n\n\nStep 2  --  Put Text into Message\nF L=1:1 S X=$$data^routine Q:X="stop value"  S\n^XMB(3.9,XMZ,2,L,0)=X\nS ^XMB(3.9,XMZ,2,0)="^3.92^"_L_"^"_L_"^"_DT\n\n\nStep 3  --  Deliver Message to Recipients\n\nS XMDUN="SENDER,LARGEMESSAGE"; A Sender can be free text or you can\n;       Leave the variable undefined and the\n;       message will appear to be from the\n;       user who was logged on.  S XMY\n("XXX@Q-AUSTIN_'Q'_DOMAIN")=""  ;  Remote Recipient S XMY(234567)=""\n;   Individual as a recipient S XMY(234567)="basket name"  ;\nIndividual as a recipient in a basket .\n.\n.\nD ENT^XMD  ;                           Call for MailMan Delivery\n\nThe message will now be delivered.  This may not happen immediately\nbecause the job of delivery the message is passed off to a 'background\nfiler'.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNote 1:        In versions of MailMan previous to Kernel Version 7, Step 1\nmay occasionally fail!  The interface, upon failing, will cause the job to\nhalt.  Because some applications require that a message be created as a\nresult of a background task, a new entry point has been created for Kernel\n7 that will not cause the process to be halted.  It will instead pass back\nto the caller an indication of success (XMZ>0) or failure (XMZ<1).  The\nuse of this new entry point is illustrated below.  IT IS RECOMMENDED that\nall applications that use the GET^XMA2entry point migrate to the XMZ^XMA2\nentry point unless the developers (being aware of the potential problem)\ndecide otherwise.  If XMZ=-1 condition is not checked, this large message\ncreation technique will stuff data into ^XMTS(3.9,-1.  This may lead to\nother problems later on!\n\n\nNote 2:        There is a way to tell MailMan to run silently via remote\ndomain when ENT1^XMD is called with the XMY("XXX@DOMAIN") set. If the\nXMCHAN or ZTQUEUED variables are set, MailMan is usually silent.  MailMan\nis silent when ZTQUEUED is present because it is a background job.\nHowever, DO NOT set the ZTQUEUED variable yourself! If anyone other than\nTaskMan ever sets ZTQUEUED, the whole intent of the variable is lost.\nCallers to the MailMan API functions and callable entry points should set\nXMCHAN to ensure silent operation.  Be sure to kill XMCHAN when completed.\n^XMB(3.9,D0,2,D1,0)\n3        TEXT                 2;0      Direct Global Write &\nThe supported references for\nMailMan include the ability for\nall DHCP packages to enter text\ndirectly into the word\nprocessing field of a message.\nSuch a reference would be to:\n\n^XMB(3.9,message#,2,line#,0)\n\nThe way to use this has been\ndocumented in MailMan\ndocumentation under the topic\nof 'Efficient Use of the\n[MailMan] Programmer\nInterface'.\n1        FROM                 0;2      Read w/Fileman\n^XMB(3.9,D0,2,0)\n3        TEXT                 2;0      Write w/Fileman\nIf you put lines into the\nglobal, you must define the\n"zero" node with:\n\n^3.92^#lines^#lines^date\n

10123	CWAD			0	The following information is from patch GMRP*2.5*22, which describes how\nthis supported reference is used.\n\nA letter from the Regional Director, Western Region, dated January 25,\n1994, subject:  Use of Electronic Mail for Patient Flagging System Among\nVA Facilities, requested a utility for flagging and disseminating critical\npatient information.  This patch is to inform all sites that such a\nmechanism is available within DHCP.  This patch corrects the problem of\nthe (A)llergy warning being indicated in the CWAD display when the patient\nhas 'No Known Allergies'.  The variable GMRPHOLD (Supported Reference\n#10123) will now be supported by Progress Notes.  If set, this variable\nwill force the user to enter a carriage return after the CWAD display.\nThis is designed to be used when an application clears the screen after a\npatient lookup.\n\nIn response to:  E3R #3056 dtd Oct 5, 1993\nNOIS: PROG DEN CWAD  dtd Mar 3, 1994\n\nThrough the Progress Notes Application, sites are able to implement a\nwarning system which notifies users of specific patient conditions.  The\nsystem is called CWAD.  The acronym stands for:\n\n"C" RISIS NOTES\nCLINICAL "W"ARNINGS\n"A"LLERGIES\nADVANCED "D"IRECTIVES\n\nTo Implement the CWAD Warning System:\n************************************\nTo implement the CWAD alert system, the variable "GMRPEN" must be set as\nan Entry Action for a particular option.  It may not be appropriate for\nthe CWAD alerts to be displayed for certain applications.  Which options\nthe CWAD is implemented with is entirely at the sites' discretion.  The\nfollowing example uses the MAS Registration Menu.  This is not to say your\nsite must implement the CWAD for this option; this is for demonstration\npurposes only.  It will work with any menu or option your site deems\nappropriate.\n\nD P^DI\n\nSelect OPTION:  1  ENTER OR EDIT FILE ENTRIES\n\nINPUT TO WHAT FILE:  OPTION// EDIT WHICH FIELD:ALL//ENTRY ACTION THEN EDIT\nFIELD:EXIT ACTION\n
